24386.0,414083,5,1,2009-01-05,414072,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/414072/performance-of-dynamic-sql-with-bind-vs-normal-sql-within-package,Performance of Dynamic SQL with Bind vs Normal SQL within Package,"<p>In an Oracle 10g environment, I have a statement that needs to be executed several million times based on the results of a cursor. For flexibility, the current code has the statement as a constant in the package body. Here is a simplified version of the code. Please keep in mind this is all within the same package:</p>

<pre><code>c_Stmt  CONSTANT VARCHAR2(128) := 'DELETE FROM t WHERE fldA = :b1';

...

PROCEDURE p1(vSomeNumber NUMBER(10)) IS
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE c_Stmt USING vSomeNumber;
END;

...

FOR i IN 1 .. 9999999
  LOOP
     p1(i);
  END LOOP;
</code></pre>

<p>Since the dynamic SQL already uses bind variables, is there any performance advantage to rewriting this code to replace the dynamic SQL with a regular DML statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>PROCEDURE p1(vSomeNumber NUMBER(10)) IS
BEGIN
  /* EXECUTE IMMEDIATE c_Stmt USING vSomeNumber; */
  DELETE FROM t WHERE fldA = vSomeNumber;
END;
</code></pre>

<p>I think the impact might be on the number of parses, but it's unclear to me if that's still a concern in 10g.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answers.</p>

One thing I am mooting is whether or not it is acceptable for a View to cause (indirectly) access to the database?</p>

<p>For example, I am using the controller to populate a custom data class with all the information I think the View needs to go about doing its job, however as I am passing objects to the view it also can cause database reads.</p>

<p>A quick pseudo example.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IProduct
{
    /* Some Members */

    /* Some Methods */
    decimal GetDiscount();
}

public class Product : IProduct
{
    public decimal GetDiscount(){ ... /* causes database access */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the View has access to the Product class (it gets passed an IProduct object), it can call GetDiscount() and cause database access. </p>

<p>I am thinking of ways to prevent this. Currently I am only coming up with multiple interface inheritance for the <code>Product</code> class. Instead of implementing just IProduct it would now implement <code>IProduct</code> and <code>IProductView</code>. IProductView would list the members of the class, IProduct would contain the method calls which could cause database access.</p>

<p>The 'View' will only know about the <code>IProductView</code> interface onto the class and be unable to call methods which cause data access. </p>

<p>I have other vague thoughts about 'locking' an object before it is passed to the view, but I can foresee huge scope for side effects with such a method.</p>

<p>So, My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any best practices regarding this issue? </li>
<li>How do other people using MVC stop the View being naughty and doing more to objects than they should?</li>
</ul>

It would appear this works, but if someone could confirm that it is ""proper"" I'd be grateful. So, if I want leaf nodes under a category with Id = 1, I would do this: </p>

<li>Is this considered as a premature or
bad optimization technique? </li>
<li>How should i properly optimize this?</li>
<li>Is there some book or resources that

It essentially looks like this (shortened for brevity to only show one application):</p>

<pre><code>using System.IO;
using System.Configuration;
public static class ExternalApplications
{

   public string App1Path
   {
      get
      {
         if(null == thisApp1Path)
            thisApp1Path = Configuration.AppSettings.Get(""App1Path"");
         return thisApp1Path;
      }
   }
   private string thisApp1Path = null;

   public bool App1Exists() 
   {
      if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(App1Path))
         throw new ConfigurationException(""App1Path not specified."");
      return File.Exists(App1Path);
   }

   public void ExecuteApp1(string args) 
   {
       // Code to launch the application.
   }

}
</code></pre>

<p>It's a nice attempt to separate the external applications from the rest of the code, but it occurs to me that this could have been refactored further. What I have in mind is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>using System.IO;
public abstract class ExternalApplicationBase
{

   protected ExternalApplicationBase()
   {
      InitializeFromConfiguration();
   }

   public string Path { get; protected set; }

   public bool Exists() 
   {
      if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.Path))
         throw new ConfigurationException(""Path not specified."");
      return File.Exists(this.Path);
   }

   public virtual void Execute(string args)
   {
      // Implementation to launch the application
   } 

   protected abstract InitializeFromConfiguration();

}

public class App1 : ExternalApplicationBase
{

   protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration()
   {
      // Implementation to initialize this application from
      // the application's configuration file.
   }

 }

 public class App2 : ExternalApplicationBase
 {

   protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration()
   {
      // Implementation to initialize this application from
      // the application's configuration file.
   }

 }
</code></pre>

<p>My concerns are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A class, interface, or other construct may already exist that does this, and I just haven't stumbled across it.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be overkill for what I want to do. Note, however, that the application uses at least three separate 3rd party applications that I have identified so far (and more are almost certain to pop up). </p></li>
<li><p>I'm not entirely comfortable with the name of the base class. It seems fuzzy, and not very informative (but I couldn't think of much better, given that Application is already well defined, reserved by the Framework, and would create a gross level of confusion were I to use it).</p></li>
<li><p>The idea is that I want to be able to keep the application configuration data (it's path and executable name) in the App.Config file, and check for its existence when my application starts up; when my software needs to launch the software, I want to do it through a single method call, and not have the code building command lines and trying to launch the software manually (as it currently does).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I'm sending out a request for help, guidance, and suggestions. Anything you can profer is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm asking this here because I work, as I frequently do, as a sole developer at my firm; I don't have anyone else to bounce these ideas off of. You guys have tons of experience with this stuff, and it would be foolish of me not to ask for your advice, so I hope you'll all bear with me. Thanks in advance!</p>

It's an unobtrusive tag based framework for wiring up events between models, views and delegates in a GUI system. </p>

<p>Basically you have one large json file which is used describes all of the events, event handlers and bindings. The user creates their models, views and delegates all of which have no knowledge of the framework. The JSON file is passed to an init() methods, then the framework creates all of the instances needed and takes care of all the bindings, listeners etc.</p>

<p>The problems I have are two fold:</p>

<p>1) There is basically only a single public method in the framework, everything else is communicated through the mark-up in the JSON file. Therefore I have a very small testing surface for what is a large and complicated application.</p>

<p>2) One of the big roles of the application is to instantiate class's if they haven't been instantiated previously and cached. This means that I need real classes in my test code, simple mocks aren't going to cut it.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm considering a couple if solutions. The first is start testing the private methods. The second is to just stub the constructors.</p>

<p>Any one else have any ideas? </p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for your help guys, you've made some big improvements. I've written functions in the two suggested styles from your answers. Some rough testing suggests the second method is marginally faster than the first, but IMO this is outweighed by the improved readability of the first.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T1&gt;
void asciihex2( T1&amp; out, const std::string&amp; in )

    dassert( sizeof(T1::value_type)==1 );

        sscanf( in.c_str() + i, ""%02X"", &amp;tmp );

</code></pre>

<p>Some of the assumptions surronding this code:
  1: They are not intended as a generic, but are used in an anonymous name space to translate data for a specific class.
  2: The templating is required as two separate container types are being used (one being std::vector, the other a similar byte array type container from a third party library.
  3: The purpose is to be able to convert binary data of indeterminate length into strings and back again (0x1234abcd &lt;-> ""1234abcd"")
  4: assert traps errors in both debug and release modes
  5: by the time these functions are called the size of the string will already have been checked, assert is used to terminate processing if something serious has gone wrong
  6: It needs some commenting</p>

<p>Any other ideas appreciated.</p>

Is there a known framework/library which deals with dynamic loading/unloading of modules without restart?</p>

<p>The usual setup, especially for web-apps, is load balancer, several instances of application, and gradual deployment and restart of new version. I'm looking for something else - application with several services/plugins, possibly single-instance desktop application, where disabling single service is cheap, but bringing down or restarting complete application is not feasible.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about typical plugin infrastructure, where plugins can be upgraded or installed without restarting application. Do I have to program that from scratch, or is something already available? Spring-compatible and opensource is a plus, but not a requirement.</p>

a syntax error on my part, but the compiler isn't catching. Anyway, 
here is what I'm trying to do. Basically I've written my own 
repository class that essentially just wraps the Fluent Repository 
class. So here is the relevant code: </p>

<pre><code>Public Class GenericRepository(Of T As IHasIntId) 
    Private _fluentRepos As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository 
    Public Sub New(ByVal FluentRepository As 
FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository) 
        _fluentRepos = FluentRepository 
    End Sub 
    Private Sub New() 
    End Sub 
    Public Function GetById(ByVal Id As Integer) As T 
        Return Query(Function(x As T) (x.Id = Id)).FirstOrDefault 
    End Function 
    Public Function Query(ByVal w As Expression(Of System.Func(Of T, 
Boolean))) As IList(Of T) 
        Return _fluentRepos.Query(Of T)(w).ToList() 
    End Function 
End Class 
</code></pre>

<p>Then I wrote two unit tests, one that would pass in an 
InMemoryRepository and one that would use an actual NHibernate session 
to hit the real database. 
here they are: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub InMemoryTest() 
        Dim inmemRepos As New InMemoryRepository() 
        Dim p As New Product() 
        Dim id As Integer = 5 
        p.Id = id 
        p.Title = ""my product"" 
        inmemRepos.Save(p) 
        Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(inmemRepos) 
        Dim foundP = genRepos.GetById(id) 
        Assert.AreEqual(p.Title, foundP.Title) 
    End Sub 

   &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub DatabaseTest() 
        Dim session = NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.GetSession() 
        Dim flRepos As New Repository(session) 
        Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(flRepos) 
        Dim id As Integer = 1 
        Dim p = genRepos.GetById(id) 
        Assert.IsNotNull(p) 
        Assert.AreEqual(id, p.Id) 
    End Sub 
</code></pre>

<p>The InMemoryTest passed, and the DatabaseTest failed. The exception 
from the DatabaseTest was a type conversion, from int to product (or 
maybe the other way around.) I was able to ""fix"" it though. In the 
Fluent NHibernate code I changed the Query method on the Repository 
class from: </p>

<pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where).ToArray(); 
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where.Compile()).ToArray(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Now both tests pass. All of the unit tests in the Fluent NHibernate 
project pass either way.</p>

I have this example from the book that I am working on which demonstrates a race condition:</p>

<pre><code>void *thread_main(void *thread_number) {
    printf(""In thread number %d.\n"", *(int *)thread_number);
}

void main() {
    int i = 0;
    pthread_t thread;

    for( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
        printf(""Creating thread %d.\n"");
        pthread_create(&amp;thread, 0, thread_main, &amp;i);
        printf(""Created thread %d.\n"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few things I don't understand about this. First, ""In thread number 5."" gets printed many times even though it's not supposed to be in thread number 5. In the book, the example shows thread 8 getting printed many times. I also don't understand the part that says <code>*(int *)thread_number</code>. I tried changing this to just thread_number, but that just gave me strange numbers over and over again.</p>

<p>The book doesn't really explain this. Can somebody give me a clear explanation of what's going on here? I don't understand why it doesn't print something like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Creating thread 1.
&gt; In thread number 1.
&gt; Created thread 1.
&gt; Creating thread 2.
&gt; In thread number 2.
&gt; Created thread 2.
</code></pre>

<p>I know that because it's multithreaded the ""In thread number x."" part will come at different times, but I really don't get why there isn't exactly 10 ""In thread number x"" with one line for each thread I created!</p>

We needed validation for the user input for dates, so I have implemented a combination of masking for format validation and parsing for actual date validation. I have done this using a custom CellEditor for the date column.</p>

<p>Inside my MaskedCellEditor, I have a JFormattedTextField. I setup the masking for dates. Then I add an InputVerifier to allow for actual validation. My InputVerifier implements verify() to check: 1. textField.isEditValid() 2. DateValidator.ValidDate(). If either is invalid, verify returns false and the InputVerifier locks the focus into the text field (the cell editor) and a small message dialog is displayed reminding the user of the date format.</p>

<p>The error message is a small, undecorated, non-modal, non-focusable JDialog that pops up underneath the cell being edited. It disappears on a keypress or a successful date verification. It is working great except for a small edge case.</p>

<p>If the user selects a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog, it switches screens, destroying everything currently on the screen (including the table). However, since the dialog is being shown and a keypress/successful edit has not occurred, the dialog is never hidden. It remains visible in a completely unrelated context on a different screen. Once the user has switched off the screen with the table, there is no way for the user to get rid of the dialog.</p>

<p>I have debated throwing either a Timer and/or a MouseListener on the dialog itself that would cause it to disappear, but I feel that I am ignoring the actual problem. The dialog is never being disposed of and I am pretty sure its because it is still set to be visible and it is preventing the garbage collector from getting rid of it.</p>

<p>I have a Cleanup method on the panel holding the JTable, but I cannot find a good way to reference the dialog (a component of the InputVerifier) in order to get rid of it. The dialog is pretty far removed from the table's parent panel. (Panel -> JTable -> CellEditor -> JFormattedTextField -> InputVerifier -> JDialog)</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to force the dialog to be hidden when the table is destroyed? If you need more details, let me know. I'm trying not to get you guys bogged down in the details, but there is a lot going on.</p>

So far the best way I've come up with doing this is to implement a generic Optimistic which will store a copy of the original and any changes (so it will store two copies: the original and modified) of any value object that can be modified. Is this the best way of doing it?</p>

<p>For example: a UserVO will be wrapped by the generic as a Optimistic. When a change is made to the Optimistic, the change will be made to the modified copy stored in the Optimistic while the original also stored in the Optimistic will remain intact. The main issue seems to be that it will use up twice the space and hence bandwidth.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The solution needs to be database independent, and it would be useful to be able to specify an conflict resolution policy per value object. (eg. A user object might try and merge if the updated rows weren't changed, but a transaction object would always require user intervention).</p>

<p>I read about the advantages of ExecutorService in the question ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/409932/java-timer-vs-executorservice"">Java Timer vs ExecutorService</a>"" and decided to use the latter over the former. But the book talks about javax.swing.Timer and it's advantages of being specific for Swing development.</p>

<p>So, does this mean that, for Swing development (animating buttons etc.), javax.swing.Timer is still a better choice or is there a relevant class in the new Concurrent Framework that replaces it?</p>

5          5        20

<p>I need a query that will show <strong>ALL ACTIVE</strong> Entities and their schedule information for a particular ScheduleYearID.</p>

<p>Output should look like (the desired SchedulingYearID in this case is 20):</p>

<pre><code>EntityID ScheduleID
1        1
2        3
4        NULL

<p>My problem is that using this query it will not include active entities without schedule information (such as EntityID 4 in the example above).

<p>Are there any solutions that I am obviously missing without having to resort to subqueries, cursors, etc.? If not it's not a big deal, I just feel like I am missing something simple here.</p>

I seems like it should work for me, but it doesn't!  (surprise!)</p>

<p>Anyway, this is what I tried first:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
Status as status,
Address as ip,
PCName as pc_name,
(Numbers.Phone = 'CPU/' + PCName) as cpu_contact,
(Numbers.Phone = 'PC/' + PCName) as pc_contact,
(Numbers.Phone = 'LOGIN/' + PCName) as login_contact,

WHERE $where  --Generated In code
JOIN Numbers
  ON ('CPU/' + PCName = Numbers.Phone) 
  OR ('PC/' + PCName = Numbers.Phone) 
  OR ('LOGIN/' + PCName = Numbers.Phone)
</code></pre>

<p>So what I want is some boolean calculated fields and to join on similar conditions.  I would also like the result to collapse down to single rows.  For example, I think the current setup would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>status ip  cpu_contact pc_contact login_contact
-----------------------------------------------
foo    bar true        false      false
foo    bar false       true       false
foo    bar false       false      true
</code></pre>

<p>And obviously I'd rather</p>

<pre><code>status ip  cpu_contact pc_contact login_contact
-----------------------------------------------
foo    bar true        true       true

<p>Any ideas?  Database redesign isn't an option.  If it were, I'd do that :-)</p>

    const char *sql = ""insert into Animal(Zoo_ID, Animal_Num, Animal_Text) Values(?, ?, ?)"";
    for (i = 0; i &lt; ([[self animalArray] count] - 1); i++) {

        if(addStmt == nil) {
            if(sqlite3_prepare_v2(database, sql, -1, &amp;addStmt, NULL) != SQLITE_OK)

        }
        int animalNum = [[[self animalArray] objectAtIndex:i] animal_Number];
        NSString *animalText = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:[[[self animalArray] objectAtIndex:i] animal_Text]];
        sqlite3_bind_int(addStmt, 1, zoo_ID);

        sqlite3_bind_text(addStmt, 3, [animalText UTF8String], -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
        [animalText release];

        //Reset the add statement.
        sqlite3_reset(addStmt);

<p>What I think needs to be done would be taking the sqlite3_prepare_v2 command out of the for loop, start the transaction, go through the for loop, commit the transaction. However, I'm not sure what the calls for ""start the transaction"" and ""commit the transaction"" are. And would I still use sqlite3_step? Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>In perl, there is an easy (and fast) way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>my @array = qw( 1 2 3 );
my %hash;
@hash{@array} = undef;
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a hash that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    1 =&gt; undef,
    2 =&gt; undef,
    3 =&gt; undef,
}
</code></pre>

<p>The best I've come up with in Ruby is:</p>

<pre><code>array = [1, 2, 3]
hash = Hash[array.map {|x| [x, nil]}]

<p>Is there a better Ruby way? </p>

<h2>EDIT 1</h2>

<p>No, Array.include? is not a good idea. Its <strong>slow</strong>. It does a query in O(n) instead of O(1). My example array had three elements for brevity; assume the actual one has a million elements. Let's do a little benchmarking:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby -w
require 'benchmark'

array = (1..1_000_000).to_a
hash = Hash[array.map {|x| [x, nil]}]

Benchmark.bm(15) do |x|
    x.report(""Array.include?"") { 1000.times { array.include?(500_000) } }
    x.report(""Hash.include?"") { 1000.times { hash.include?(500_000) } }
end
</code></pre>

<p>Produces:</p>

<pre><code>                     user     system      total        real
Array.include?  46.190000   0.160000  46.350000 ( 46.593477)

<p><strong>NotImplementedException.</strong>  You are pulling my leg, right?</p>

<p>No, I'm not going to take the cheap stab at this by saying, ""hang on, the method is implemented - it throws a NotImplementedException.""  Yes, that's right, you have to implement the method to throw a NotImplementedException (unlike a pure virtual function call in C++ - now that makes sense!).  While that's pretty damn funny, there is a more serious problem in my mind.</p>

<p>I just wonder, in the presence of the NotImplementedException, how can anyone do anything with .Net?  Are you expected to wrap every abstract method call with a try catch block to guard against methods that might not be implemented?  If you catch such an exception, what the heck are you supposed to do with it??</p>

<p>I see no way to test if a method is actually implemented without calling it.  Since calling it may have side effects, I can't do all my checks up-front and then run my algorithm.  I have to run my algorithm, catch NotImplementedExceptions and the some how roll back my application to some sane state.</p>

<p>It's crazy.  Mad.  Insane.  So the question is:  <strong>Why does the NotImplementedException exist</strong>?</p>

<p>As a preemptive strike, I do not want anyone to respond with, ""because designers need to put this in the auto-generated code.""  This is horrid.  I would rather the auto-generated code not compile until you supply an implementation.  For example, the auto generated implementation could be ""throw NotImplementedException;"" where the NotImplementedException is not defined!</p>

<p>Has anyone ever caught and handled a NotImplementedException?  Have you ever left a NotImplementedException in your code?  If so, did this represent a time bomb (ie, you accidentally left it there), or a design flaw (the method should not be implemented and will never be called)?</p>

<p>I'm very suspicious of the NotSupportedException also...  Not supported?  What the?  If it's not supported, why is it part of your interface?  Can anyone at Microsoft spell improper inheritance?  But I might start another question for that if I don't get too abuse for this one. </p>

<p>There seems to be a strong agreement with <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/07/29/201354.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brad Abrams</a> that ""NotImplementedException is for functionality that is just not yet implemented, but really should (and will be).  Something like what you might <em>start</em> with when you are building a class, get all the methods there throwing NotImplementedException, then flush them out with real code…""</p>

<p>Comments from <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/12/12/notimplementedexception-vs-notsupportedexception.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jared Parsons</a> are very weak and should probably be ignored: NotImplementedException: Throw this exception when a type does not implement a method for any other reason.</p>

<li>Provides for locking down some posts (when the spammers come for it)</li>

I get indeterminate when I divide zero by zero. How do you check for infinite and indeterminate values in C++?</p>

<p>In C++, infinity is represented by 1.#INF. Indeterminate is represented by -1.#IND. The problem is how to test if a variable is infinite or indeterminate. Checking infinity is relatively straightforward: You find the infinity definition in your particular C++. For my case (VS2003), it is std::numeric_limits::infinity(). You have to include ""limits"" in order to use it. You can assign this infinite value to a variable and you can compare it to some value in order to check if that value is infinite.</p>

<p>Indeterminate is a little tricky, because you cannot compare an indeterminate value to some other value. Any comparison returns false. You can use this property to detect an indeterminate value by comparing it to itself. Let's say you have a double variable called aVal. Under normal conditions, aVal != aVal returns false. But if the value is indeterminate, aIndVal != aIndVal returns true. This weird situation is not present for infinite values, i.e. aInfVal != aInfVal always returns false.</p>

<p>Here are two functions that can be used to check for indeterminate and infinite values:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""limits.h""
#include ""math.h""

bool isIndeterminate(const double pV)
{
    return (pV != pV);
} 

bool isInfinite(const double pV)
{
    return (fabs(pV) == std::numeric_limits::infinity())
}
</code></pre>

<p>Are there better ways for these checks, am I missing anything?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OK. That's clear. So the <em>call to the method</em> will not be compiled. But what about side effects?</p>

Baz ret3 = ret2.getAnotherThing();

<p><strong>My conclusion on the answers:</strong><br />
Some answers told me that I should not chain getters one after another, some answers showed my how to debug my code if I disobeyed that advice.</p>
<p>I've accepted an answer that taught me exactly when to chain getters:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they cannot return null, chain them as long as you like. No need for checking != null, no need to worry about NullPointerExceptions (<em>be warned that chaining still violates the Law of Demeter, but I can live with that</em>)</li>
<li>If they may return null, don't ever, never ever chain them, and perform a check for null values on each one that may return null</li>

<pre><code>boost::function f&lt;(void)(MyObject*, int, int)&gt; = &amp;MyObject::method_that_takes_two_ints;

<p>What does the standard dictate about the placement of the 'this' parameter? Perhaps just on my compiler the extra 'this' argument comes first, and maybe on other compilers it could be on the end? Am I just lucky that my way of thinking is consistent with how my compilers (GCC4, VS2005) handle it? Are pointer-to-member-functions always just a special case of pointer-to-functions with an extra parameter or can the compiler implement them differently?</p>

It is a custom class because we are not allowed to install additional software on our servers (nLog, log4net, etc).</p>

<p>I currently use it in two of my projects and have seen some good results from it.  Right now I am trapping the errors that cause page and application errors.  It sends and stores the error message and all inner exceptions.  </p>

<p>The problem I am having now is, I am receiving errors that I am not quite sure how to reproduce.  I have not heard any error reports from any of my users.  I am not sure what they are doing, or even if they are seeing these as errors.</p>

<p>I am thinking about creating an Event Log on each page, or the ones I want additional information on.  Keeping it as a Session variable on the page, and writing events to it (start/end of functions, variable changes, etc).  Then only if an error is called to have that send along with the error message to see if it gives a better picture of what is going on.  I am hoping that doing it this way will not give me tons of event logs when all users access the application, just want was going on right before the error happen with the one user.</p>

<p>Do you know of any pitfalls I should watchout with method?</p>

<p>Do you have any advise for things to look for?  </p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>@Saret: I understnad where you are coming from with that response and I agree.  I am fairly new to this company and still need to learn how they do things.  In the past I have had conversations with my coworkers how it would be great to have this product, or use this open source project.  The problem comes down to is, we work on secure systems and getting approval to get these things takes a lot of time, top cover, and dealing with all the red tape.  I will look into the situation further because I believe having a good error logging system in place is important, currently nothing is being used.</p>

<p>@Jim Blizard: I wanted to try to get away from logging/storing everything someplace to come back and find out what is important to the situation that caused the error.  I didn't want to fall into overload of information that is talked about in artical that Roberto Barros linked.  My current method of thinking is, keeping a string in memory on each page, and if an error is rasied, on the pages Page_Error event, grab that string and attach it to the exception that is getting logged.  That way I am only logging the error/exceptions that occured and storing the event log with that error.  If nothing happens, that log that was being created is dropped into the bit bucket never to be seen again.</p>

<p>@Roberto Barros:  Thanks for that link, I remember reading it somewhere but forgot to save it.</p>

There also is a nice discussion when to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/175532/return-null-or-throw-exception"">return ‘null’ or throw exception </a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'm writing a method and I already know if I want to return null or throw an exception, what is the best way to express my decision, in other words, to document my contract?</strong></p>

<p>Some ways I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write it down in the specs / the documentation (will anyone read it?)</li>
<li>Make it part of the method name (as I suggested <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/175532/return-null-or-throw-exception#411400"" title=""answer on &#39;Return null or throw exception&#39;"">here</a>)</li>
<li>assume that every method that <em>throws</em> an exception will <em>not</em> return null, and every one that does 'not' throw <em>might</em> return null.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm mainly talking about java, but it might apply to other languages, too: Why is there a formal way to express if exceptions will be thrown (the <code>throws</code> keywords) but no formal way to express if null might be returned? </p>

<p>Why isn't there something like that:</p>

<pre><code>public notnull Object methodWhichCannotReturnNull(int i) throws Exception
{
    return null; // this would lead to a compiler error!
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary and Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many ways to express the contract:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your IDE supports it (as IntelliJ), it's best to use an annotation like <code>@NotNull</code> because it is visible to the programmer and can be used for automated compile time checking. There's a <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/eclipse/"" rel=""noreferrer"">plugin for Eclipse</a> to add support for these, but it didn't work for me.</li>
<li>If these are not an option, use custom Types like <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>NotNull&lt;T&gt;</code>, which add clarity and at least runtime checking.</li>
<li>In any way, documenting the contract in the JavaDoc never hurts and sometimes even helps.</li>
<li>Using method names to document the <em>nullability</em> of the return value was not proposed by anyone but me, and though it might be very verbose und not always useful, I still believe sometimes it has its advantages, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know how to parse URL's, that's easy enough.  But in my mind, that seems slow and cumbersome on a dynamic site.  As well, if the pages are all staticly built (hende the custom URL) then that means all components of the page are static as well... (which would be bad)</p>

I'm wondering what the best way of managing string resources is. I understand the principles behind resource bundles etc. I'd like to avoid having one property file for every class that needs a string, as this seems a bit of overkill. Especially when you have a lot of classes that may only make a single reference to a string (say in an error handler). On the other hand it makes it easier when collaborating with others as you reduce the risk of merge conflicts.</p>

<p>It seems particularly cumbersome to have to load resource bundles, every time you need to display simple user feedback, likewise in error handlers, when many classes are involved.</p>

<p>What is the most effective way to manage strings in a fairly large application with hundreds of classes, many of which aren't GUI related, but need to pass informative messages back up to the GUI when exceptions occur.</p>

<p>One cheap alternative I can think of is to call additional method after getting the dialog widget like so:</p>

<pre><code>dialog = builder.get_object(""mydialog-instance"")
dialog.bind_widgets(builder)
</code></pre>

<p>But that seems fairly awkward. Has anyone solved this already or has a better idea on how to go about doing it?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The specific application is this:</p>

<p>A user can upload as many pictures as they want on the image upload form. Once the pictures are uploaded they are taken to a page where they can give the pictures a name and description. The number of pictures will depend on how many the user has chosen to upload.</p>

<p>So <strong>how do I get django to generate a form using a variable number of input fields</strong> (which could be passed as an argument if necessary)?</p>

from tagging.forms import TagField

I can try writing bytes to the socket directly instead of ints, and I get the same thing. I can write more or less data, same result. UTF strings same result. Even when specifying ""4"" as the packet header length, I just get the same consistent result of <code>[&lt;&lt;0,0,0,32&gt;&gt;]</code> instead. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong here.</p>

<p>I have dabbled in the built-in unit testing tools in Visual Studio, but I have found it difficult to run tests that hit a database. Since the data changes, and combined with the fact that I have little idea what I'm doing, it seems very difficult to produce expected results and assert against them. Also I've even heard that you shouldn't run unit tests against databases... but how does everyone else out there perform unit tests on CRUD LOB software?</p>

<p>I hear so much about TDD and continuous integration with testing, but it seems like if i can't even create unit tests to begin with, I can't really use those methodologies. It makes since that a product like Notepad would be an easy one to create unit tests for... you have a certain amount of features and those features should always produce the same result. But with LOB applications, you've got things like Sales Orders that could be created or deleted or modified in your testing environment.</p>

<p>Any insight would be appreciated!</p>

My goal is to utilize an open source relational database for the data storage portion and I'm aware of two solid databases that are widely supported: MySQL and PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>For a system that will require transactions, stored procedures, functions, and security, are there any opinions on which of these two databases would be best suited for an accounting application or is there another database I'm missing?</p>

<p><em>Let me add: This is not an accounting need like Quickbooks or Peachtree. This is basically a system that handles accounting for a specific business service we provide. There are maybe two or three systems that cater to this need, are priced in the six figure range before any customization, and would require my small firm to be married to a vendor for the long-term. Thus, we are building the application in-house.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, while I appreciate the <strong>Buy vs. Build</strong> argument, I'd like to move away from that particular religious question because the Buy road was already taken and the vendor failed miserably.

I have defined a custom <code>JComponent</code> (call it <code>Picture</code>) and, after embedding it in a <code>JScrollPane</code>, I put it in a <code>JPanel</code> that uses DesignGridLayout manager. </p>

<p>DesignGridLayout supports baseline alignment thanks to <strong>swing-layout</strong> open source library (implements baseline support for Java 5 and provides compatibility with the new Java 6 baseline support).</p>

<p>My <code>Picture</code> class <em>overrides</em> <code>public int getBaseline(int width, int height)</code> so that I can define a correct baseline for it. Note that ""<em>override</em>"" is not completely correct: it overrides the method on Java6 but defines it in Java5.</p>

<p>When I run my sample app <strong>on Java5, everything is fine</strong>: the <code>Picture</code> baseline I have defined is correctly used.</p>

<p>However, <strong>when I use Java6</strong>, my <code>Picture#getBaseline()</code> method does not get called! And of course <strong>the baseline alignment of my picture is terrible</strong> (centered).</p>

<p>After checking in Java6 source, I have seen that, in <code>BasicScrollPaneUI</code>, <code>getBaseline()</code> calls first <code>getBaselineResizeBehavior()</code> on the viewport component (my <code>Picture</code> instance).
And it will call <code>getBaseline()</code> only if <code>getBaselineResizeBehavior()</code> returns <code>Component.BaselineResizeBehavior.CONSTANT_ASCENT</code>.</p>

<p>Now my problem is that <code>getBaselineResizeBehavior()</code> is a Java6 method of <code>JComponent</code> that I cannot implement in Java5 because it returns an enum <code>Component.BaselineResizeBehavior</code> which does not exist in Java5.</p>

<p>So my question (finally) is: how can I implement (or simulate?) <code>getBaselineResizeBehavior()</code> so that my class can still compile and run in a Java5 environment?</p>

<p>I have 1 UINavigationController and 2 subclasses of UIViewController.</p>

<p>I have a MainWindow.xib file, a PersonListView.xib, and a PersonDetailView.xib.</p>

<p>The MainWindow.xib has the UINavigationController with the view linked over to the PersonListView.xib file.</p>

<p>The PersonListView.xib has the File's Owner listed as a PersonListViewController class.</p>

<p>I have some buttons on the PersonListView, along with labels and images.  All displays correctly.</p>

<p>When I try to link a button on the PersonListView to my PersonListViewController class, the button is not firing....</p>

<p>The result:
 <strong>* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*</strong> -[UIViewController viewDetail]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x450d50'</p>

<p>If I go into the debug console and print-object 0x450d50, I get:</p>

<p>(gdb) print-object 0x450d50

(gdb) </p>

<p>The Interface Builder correctly shows the File's Owner as a PersonListViewController, so why would my button action (linked to the File's Owner) go to the superclass somehow?</p>

<p>EDIT1: Ok, what seems to be happening is that I wasn't getting an instance of the subclass unless, in my MainWindow.xib, I explicitly set the class of the view controller to my subclass.</p>

<p>There's still got to be something I'm missing, though, because surely I should be able to start up arbitrary subclasses of UIViewController just by swapping out the NIB file name from the main window?</p>

<p>EDIT2: (Response to Kevin)
That's not what I'm saying regarding the contents of a XIB.  </p>

<p>I have 3 XIBs:</p>

<p>MainWindow
PeopleListView
PeopleDetailView</p>

<p>The PeopleListView and PeopleDetailView each have an associated File's Owner that is a corresponding UIViewController subclass.  Obviously, I need my events to go to the right controller classes as I move from page to page...but if I can only use a default UIViewController or one subclass, that will be much more difficult?</p>

<p>I can get the correct effect in code by manually setting up the UINavigationController with the correct root, but I feel like there should be a better way through InterfaceBuilder.</p>

<p>EDIT3: (to Kendall)
I'm not using a tab bar.  The model is the same, though, that the view in my navigation controller has to be wired to a single subclass, which seems a bit icky.</p>

<p>EDIT4: (to lostintransit)
The PersonListViewController has the appropriate - (IBAction) viewDetail; method.  The problem is that I can't find a way, in my MainWindow.xib, to flag the view inside my UINavigationController as ""initially load this from PersonListView.xib, with a PersonListViewController as the view"" that wouldn't make it difficult to replace the PersonListView with a PersonDetailView.</p>

UPDATE tbl SET title='b1' WHERE title IN ('b-1', 'b.1')

<p>This isn't at all a problem, if the table is small, and the single statement completes in less than a second and you only need a few statements to execute.</p>

<p>You probably guested it - I have a huge table to deal with (one statement completes in about 90 seconds), and I have a huge number of updates to perform.</p>

<p>So, is it possible to merge the updates so it would only scan the table once? Or perhaps, there's a better way to deal with in a situation like this.</p>

<p>EDIT: Note, that the real data I'm working with and the changes to the data I have to perform are not really that simple - the strings are longer and they don't follow any pattern (it is user data, so no assumptions can be made - it can be anything).</p>

<p>I wrote this code, but it doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

    int n_;
    adder (int n) : n_(n) {}

<p>and I got message from g++, says <code>invalid use of non-static member function</code>.</p>

<p>How do I get pointer to member function of instance?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:My original problem is about Win32 API.</p>

<p>I'm forced to write windows program with old Win32 API at school. but I don't want to write horrible switch statement like some example codes on text. Then, I decided to write wrapper in C++.</p>

<p>I want to write the window class like ... </p>

<pre><code>class Window {
public:
    LRESULT update (HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM);
    void run();
    // below methods are called by update()
    virtual void onclick(int, int);
    virtual void ondraw(); // ... and more methods
};
</code></pre>

<p>and I'm willing to write my application class with deriving this class and overloading some methods.</p>

<p>Finally, my actual probrem is how to do this in C++.</p>

<pre><code> // on initializing my window object,
 // I must register window class with callback which is 
 // not a C++ function object.
 // I try to explain what I want to do with psudocode mixing C++ and javascript.
 WNDCLASS wndclass;
 Window *self = this;
 wndclass.lpfnWndProc = function () {
     return self.update.apply(self, argunemts);
 };
</code></pre>

<p>In other word, I have to make closure into function pointer. I don't know how to do this, but I can't believe this can't do in C++.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The original title of this question was <em>How to get pointer-to-member-function of instance</em>. But this title and my question didn't tell my actual problem enough. Sorry to early answerers, and litb, thank you for suggestion and very useful answer!</p>

<p>Basically I want to avoid bugs like the following:</p>

<pre><code>int age = 27;

std::wstring str = std::wstring(L""User's age is: "");
str += age;

std::string str2 = std::string(""User's age is: "");
str2 += age;

<p>The above code will add the ascii character 27 to the string instead of the number 27.</p>

<p>Note: You can override += on std::string and int to properly format the string, but this is not what I want to do.  I want to completely disallow this operator on these operands. </p>

They could import resources(pdf,img,etc) to be kept along with their projects.
So now i want to create a feature which allows the user to export all their stuff and those people who are in the same group as them all neatly with pretty ribbon tied in a zip file.</p>

<p>Currently i'm using Archive:Zip to zip up the file preemptively, keep their CRC32 checksum and running this as a daily cronjob to cut the user waiting time down. But if there's any changes to any of the files i will have to rerun the whole thing.</p>

<p>My initial benchmark shows me that 103MB of file will takes up to 47secs to run.
The process involve generating XML linking them to XSL, copying images, html for the iframes and what not.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of creating a table or a text file to keep CRC32 checksum or last modified date for all of the files in a temporarily storage area and compare with this list each time the user click on export, and if there's any new files, i will remove the same file from the cached zip file and add in the new file. Or i will just keep all the loose files and copy and replace the newer files and then do the archive on each click.</p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is this considered as a premature or
bad optimization technique? </li>
<li>How should i properly optimize this?</li>
<li>Is there some book or resources that
I can learn for these sort of
optimization techniques?</li>

One problem: I have no idea how to do this.I will need to enter data (like times on a time sheet, for exampls)  Can anyone steer me in the right direction to acquire this skill?</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL SPECS:  I wrote the original post late at night so may not have been as detailed as I should have.  Here is an example:  My client has an ERP app that they use to collect time stamps from the line workers as they perform their jobs and get projects out the door throughout the day.  This app does NOT have an API I can use to feed data into.  I have heard of a guy who was able to actually push data onto the screen in this app's windows and controls programmatically, such that the data was able to be collected into, say, an Excel worksheet, then effectively uploaded into this app.  Sort of a reverse screen-scrape.  It's not pretty like an API would be, but it works.</p>

<p>I've seen app's interact with other apps in a similar way.  One good example I can think of is SnagIt, the screenshot utility.  You can order it to screen capture a window in a particular app, and as you move your mouse around that window, the controls under the pointer will outline in red to indicate which control it will capture for you.  I think that is interesting, and probably just a step away from actually being able to type text <em>into</em> such a control.</p>

Therefore I have to handle a lot of Parameters. Now the Idea is that I have two classes, one for a SingleParameter and a Collection of parameters. I use property() to access the parameter value easy and to make the code more readable. This works perfect for a sinlge parameter but I don't know how to implement it for the collection as I want to name the property in Collection after the SingleParameter. Here an example:</p>

<pre><code>class SingleParameter(object):
  def __init__(self, name, default_value=0, unit='not specified'):
    self.name = name
    self.default_value = default_value
    self.unit = unit
    self.set(default_value)
  def get(self):
    return self._v
  def set(self, value):
    self._v = value
  v = property(fget=get, fset=set, doc='value of parameter')

par1 = SingleParameter(name='par1', default_value=10, unit='mV')
par2 = SingleParameter(name='par2', default_value=20, unit='mA')

# par1 and par2 I can access perfectly via 'p1.v = ...'
# or get its value with 'p1.v'

class Collection(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.dict = {}
  def __getitem__(self, name):
    return self.dict[name] # get the whole object
    # to get the value instead:
    # return self.dict[name].v
  def add(self, parameter):
    self.dict[parameter.name] = parameter
    # now comes the part that I don't know how to implement with property():
    # It shoule be something like
    # self.__dict__[parameter.name] = property(...) ?

col = Collection()
col.add(par1)
col.add(par2)
col['par1'] # gives the whole object

# Now here is what I would like to get:
# col.par1 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v
# col.par1 = 5 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v = 5

<p>Edit: Thanks for your help guys, you've made some big improvements. I've written functions in the two suggested styles from your answers. Some rough testing suggests the second method is marginally faster than the first, but IMO this is outweighed by the improved readability of the first.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T1&gt;
void asciihex2( T1&amp; out, const std::string&amp; in )
{
    dassert( sizeof(T1::value_type)==1 );
    size_t size = in.size();
assert( !(size % 2) );
    out.resize( size / 2 );
    T1::iterator outit = out.begin();
    for( size_t i = 0; i &lt; in.size(); i += 2 )
    {
        int tmp;
        sscanf( in.c_str() + i, ""%02X"", &amp;tmp );
        *outit++ = tmp;
    }
}

template&lt;class T1&gt;
void asciihex3( T1&amp; out, const std::string&amp; in )
{
    dassert( sizeof(T1::value_type)==1 );
    size_t size = in.size();
assert( !(size % 2) );
    out.resize( size / 2 );
    T1::iterator outit = out.begin();
const char hexDigits[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
                          0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
                  0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x0E, 0x0F};
for( std::string::const_iterator it = in.begin(); it != in.end(); it += 2, ++outit )
    {
    *outit = (hexDigits[(*it - 0x30) &amp; 0x1f] &lt;&lt; 4) + 
              hexDigits[((*(it+1) - 0x30) &amp; 0x1f)];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the assumptions surronding this code:
  1: They are not intended as a generic, but are used in an anonymous name space to translate data for a specific class.
  2: The templating is required as two separate container types are being used (one being std::vector, the other a similar byte array type container from a third party library.
  3: The purpose is to be able to convert binary data of indeterminate length into strings and back again (0x1234abcd &lt;-> ""1234abcd"")
  4: assert traps errors in both debug and release modes
  5: by the time these functions are called the size of the string will already have been checked, assert is used to terminate processing if something serious has gone wrong
  6: It needs some commenting</p>

<p>Any other ideas appreciated.</p>

<p>My basic wish is to host a DNS server that represents the following lookup table:</p>

 *.devdomain2.dev | 192.168.10.2

<p>Do you know how to setup this in BIND 9? Or maybe there is an easier solution that I've overlooked. I know I could add the individual subdomains in my HOSTS file but since we have a lot of subdomains which has to be maintained on several dev machines I would rather have a simple wildcard setup.</p>

But i totally failed to google up one.</p>

<p>Situation is quite simple - server is the central node, that multiple clients connect to and manipulate same data. Data can be split in atoms, in case of conflict, whatever is on server, has priority (to avoid getting user into conflict solving). Partial synchronization is preferred due to potentially large amounts of data.</p>

<p>Are there any patterns / good practices for such situation, or if you don't know of any - what would be your approach?</p>

<p>Below is how i now think to solve it:
Parallel to data, a modification journal will be held, having all transactions timestamped. 
When client connects, it receives all changes since last check, in consolidated form (server goes through lists and removes additions that are followed by deletions, merges updates for each atom, etc.).
Et voila, we are up to date.</p>

<p>Alternative would be keeping modification date for each record, and instead of performing data deletes, just mark them as deleted.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Our problem is that we are building a complex (as in, many objects refer to each other) stateful RIA system. It seems as Hibernate is designed to be used mainly on one-off applications - JSF and the like.</p>

<p>The problem is mainly that of lazy loading. Since there can be several HTTP requests between the initialization and actually loading lazy collections, a session per transaction is out of the question. A long-lived session (one per application) doesn't work well either, because once a transaction hits a snag and throws an exception, the whole session is invalidated, thus the lazy loaded objects break. Then there's all kinds of stuff that just don't work for us (like implicit data persisting of data from outside an initialized transaction).</p>

<p>My poor explanations aside, the bottom line is that Hibernate does magic we don't like. It seems like TopLink isn't any better, it also being written on top of EJB.</p>

<p>So, a stateless persistence layer (or even bright-enough object-oriented database abstraction layer) is what we would need the most.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, or am I asking for something that doesn't exist?</p>

I can't seem to find any best practices out there and would like to know what is good or bad.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'm seeing some methods signatures that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public decimal CalcSomething(Date start, Date end, out int someOtherNumber){}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, it's just a feeling, this doesn't sit well with me. For some reason, I'd prefer to see:</p>

<pre><code>public Result CalcSomething(Date start, Date end){}
</code></pre>

<p>where the result is a type that contains a decimal and the someOtherNumber. I think this makes it easier to read. It allows Result to be extended or have properties added without breaking code. It also means that the caller of this method doesn't have to declare a locally scoped ""someOtherNumber"" before calling. From usage expectations, not all callers are going to be interested in ""someOtherNumber"".</p>

<p>As a contrast, the only instances that I can think of right now within the .Net framework where ""out"" parameters make sense are in methods like TryParse(). These actually make the caller write simpler code, whereby the caller is primarily going to be interested in the out parameter. </p>

<pre><code>int i;
if(int.TryParse(""1"", i)){
  DoSomething(i);
}

<p>I'm thinking that ""out"" should only be used if the return type is bool and the expected usages are where the ""out"" parameters will always be of interest to the caller, by design. </p>

<p><strong>The Domain Model</strong></p>

<p>Let's say I have two parallel class hierarchies: Animal, Dog, Cat and AnimalOwner, DogOwner, CatOwner where Dog and Cat both inherit from Animal and DogOwner and CatOwner both inherit from AnimalOwner. AnimalOwner has a reference of type Animal called OwnedAnimal.</p>

<p>Here are the classes in the example:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Animal
{
   // some properties
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
   // some more properties
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
   // some more properties
}

public class AnimalOwner 
{
   public virtual Animal OwnedAnimal {get;set;}
   // more properties...
}

public class DogOwner : AnimalOwner
{
   // even more properties
}

public class CatOwner : AnimalOwner
{
   // even more properties
}
</code></pre>

<p>The classes have proper nhibernate mapping, all properties are persistent and everything that can be lazy loaded is lazy loaded.</p>

<p>The application business logic only let you to set a Dog in a DogOwner and a Cat in a CatOwner.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>I have code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void ProcessDogOwner(DogOwner owner)
{
   Dog dog = (Dog)owner.OwnedAnimal;
   ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method can be called by many diffrent methods, in most cases the dog is already in memory and everything is ok, but rarely the dog isn't already in memory - in this case I get an nhibernate ""uninitialized proxy"" but the cast throws an exception because nhibernate genrates a proxy for Animal and not for Dog.</p>

<p>I understand that this is how nhibernate works, but I need to know the type without loading the object - or, more correctly I need the uninitialized proxy to be a proxy of Cat or Dog and not a proxy of Animal.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can't change the domain model, the model is handed to me by another department, I tried to get them to change the model and failed.</li>
<li>The actual model is much more complicated then the example and the classes have many references between them, using eager loading or adding joins to the queries is out of the question for performance reasons.</li>
<li>I have full control of the source code, the hbm mapping and the database schema and I can change them any way I want (as long as I don't change the relationships between the model classes).</li>
<li>I have many methods like the one in the example and I don't want to modify all of them.</li>
</ul>

I now want to present a list of these files to the user to choose from.  In this list, I want to show some of the details about the file, which are properties of the root object.  I don't want to load the whole graph into memory, since I'm only interested in displaying properties of the root node.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a way to control the ""depth"" of the deserialization so that I can just pull the root object from the file and skip over the children?  I'd rather avoid treating the file as raw XML, since I'm not doing any raw XML manipulations anywhere else, and that would be one more branch of code that I have to keep in sync.</p>

<p>My only idea right now is to create a compatible ""summary"" object containing only the properties I'm interested in, and none of the children, and deserialize the file into that.  This should skip the children since they are not relevant to the summary object.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to accomplish this?</p>

<p><strong>Update/Clarification</strong>:  Attributes are not the answer I'm looking for.  For one thing, they'll prevent the ""extra"" properties from ending up in the file when the object was first serialized.  </p>

<p>Second, they're more permanent than what I'm trying to do.  Eventually, I do want to deserialize the entire file, just not at this point.  I'm trying to show a summary list of files that the user will choose from for import.  During the import, I'm going to need all the children and grandchildren.  It's just overkill during step 1.  These are potentially large files, so fully deserializing several of them just so I can display their header information isn't going to work.</p>

However, even a simple test such as writing the GUID out to the screen is giving me problems - it prints the GUID but ignores everything after it (e.g. HTML tags, additional words, anything).</p>

<p>Here's the rudimentary code to test this:</p>

<pre><code>Set typeLib = Server.CreateObject(""Scriptlet.TypeLib"")
myGuid = typeLib.Guid
Response.Write myGuid &amp; "" is the new GUID""
Set typeLib = Nothing

<p>This will display something like <em>{9DDB27D1-F034-41D7-BB88-D0D811DB91CE}</em> and that's it; the rest of the text is ignored and isn't written out.  However, if I hard-code that GUID value and reference it from a variable, the rest of the text appears just fine.  I've tried explicit conversion to a String value before displaying, but it still happens.</p>

<p>(The relational view of the above data is different.  Each row contains the following columns: Revision, FileId, Value.

<ul>
<li>avoids replication and uses space efficiently (currently the non-sparse representation requires 260 GB (data+index) for less than 10% of the data I want to store)</li>
<li>allows me to retrieve efficiently the values for a specific revision using an SQL query (without explicitly looping through revisions or files) </li>

<p>Ideally, the solution should not depend on a particular <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RDBMS</a> and should be compatible with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_%28Java%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hibernate</a>.

We're still learning, but we've definitely exposed and fixed some problems in our development process already. So in general I think it has been good for us.</p>

<p>In reading many of the internet musings about Scrum from evangelists, cynics and everyone in between, three common and somewhat contradictory themes have stood out to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scrum implementation fails because the processes of Scrum are not followed closely enough.</li>
<li>Scrum implementation fails because the organization does not adapt Scrum to its own environment/culture/practices.</li>
<li>The processes of Scrum are not important; only the values in the Agile Manifesto matter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Examples of these can be seen in the responses to these SO questions:</p>

</ul>

<p>I have to admit that we're not yet following all the guidelines of Scrum: we haven't done a release at the end of the sprints, our Scrum Master doesn't want us to move tasks out of the sprint backlog near the end of the sprint so that he can see how much our planning was off (which means the burndown chart never goes to 0), and urgent customer support issues still have incredible power to disrupt everyone's planning, for a few examples.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> in trying to solve these and other issues, is it better to try and be closer to the official Scrum processes, better to be closer to some of our pre-Scrum processes, or better to meditate on the principles of Scrum to try and come up with a different process altogether?</p>

All of my development work involves internal tools, mostly in Java, so nothing that is released to the public. Right now, I feel like my development workflow is very ""hobbyist"" and is nothing like you would see at an experienced software development firm. I would be inclined to say that it doesn't really matter since I'm the only developer anyway, but it can't hurt to make some changes, if for no other reason than to make my job a little easier and get a few more technologies on my resume. Right now my workflow is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I do most of my development work in Eclipse on my laptop. Everything is saved locally on my laptop, and I don't use a VCS, nor do I really backup my code (except for occasionally emailing it to myself so I can see it on a different computer - yeah, I told you my development environment needs work). </p></li>
<li><p>When I'm done with a project and want to deploy it or if I just want to test it, I use the built-in Jar tool in Eclipse to make an executable .jar of my project. If I use external .jar libraries, I use the Fat-Jar plugin to include those .jars in my executable .jar. </p></li>
<li><p>After I create the .jar, I manually upload it to the server via SFTP and test it with something like <code>java -jar MyProject.jar</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Oh yeah, did I mention that I don't unit test? </p>

<p>The most glaringly obvious problem that I'd like to fix first is my lack of source control. I like git because of it's distributed nature, but it doesn't seem to integrate with Eclipse well and I've heard that it doesn't work very well on Windows, which is my primary development OS. So, I'm leaning toward SVN, which I do have some experience with. I do have my own personal server, and I think I'll use that for my source control, because I'd rather be my own admin than have to deal with university bureaucracy. I had some trouble setting up SVN once before, but I'll give it another shot. Maybe I'll also install something like Trac or Redmine for bug-tracking, todo list, etc?</p>

<p>What about building and deployment? There has to be a better way than using Fat-Jar and manually uploading my jar to the server. I've heard about tools like Ant and Maven - do these apply to what I want to do? How can I get started using those? </p>

<p>I suppose I'd eventually like to integrate unit testing with JUnit too. Even though it probably should be, that is not my primary concern right now, because so far my applications aren't terribly complex. I'd really like to work on simplifying and streamlining my workflow right now, and then I'll ease into unit testing. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long question. I guess my question boils down to, for a sole developer, what tools and methodologies can/should I be using to not only make my job easier, but also just to expose myself to some technologies that would be expected requisite knowledge at a dedicated development house?</p>

<hr>

<p>edit: Thanks for the great answers so far. I didn't mean to suggest that I wanted to make my workflow ""enterprisey"" just for the sake of doing it, but to make my job simpler and to get a few technologies under my belt that are typically used in enterprise development environments. That's all I meant by that.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I understand everyone's concern for <code>SELECT *</code>.  I know the risks associated with <code>SELECT *</code>.

<p>In my workplace, we have a very old WinForms product (in market since 1994, and still running on VB3). It has three very different versions, each of them goes to one client. The clients pass it on to their users, some of which are shared. The versions can live side-by-side.</p>

<p>Five years ago, we rewrote one of those versions in C#.Net. Two years later, another version (let's call it version M) was rewritten, and two years after that, it was time for the last remaining version (let's call it version C) to be converted. We've been working for one year, and are going to production this week.</p>

<p>During the conversions, it has been decided not to convert anything that was sold as an external module; these were built in VB6, and they used several controls from <a href=""http://www.becubed.com/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BeCubed</a> and <a href=""http://www.fpoint.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FarPoint</a>. There are two such modules in version M, and three modules in version C.
Each module has it's own MSI installer, which is run quietly by the main product's installer.</p>

<h3>The bug</h3>

<p>During production, we found a bug: when version C in installed on a fresh computer, then version M is installed, we get a message as soon as an external module is opened in version C:</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh3.ggpht.com/_L2AGN2rr3tM/SWJBoWNPcVI/AAAAAAAACaA/pPNTMywh4Gw/BeCubed.PNG"" alt=""BeCubed error""></p>

<p>After clicking Ok, the module works. Also, this doesn't happen when they are installed in any other order and both modules in version M work perfectly.</p>

<h3>Other details</h3>

<ul>
<li>All OCX and DLL files have been compared through all the module setups; the files are identical.  </li>
<li>All modules work when only one version M or C is installed, or when M is installed first.  </li>
<li>We have licenses for all the software we use, including BeCubed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone know what could cause such an error, what could be a possible solution?</p>

For this, we use OpenNetCF's DateTimeHelper class, which seems to serve as a wrapper around Win32 P/Invokes.</p>

<p>One of the other features of the task manager is that if a task runs longer than its allotted time window, the task manager will Thread.Abort() it to allow other tasks to run. We're seeing an alarming number of thread abortions in which the highest function on the stack is OpenNetCF.WindowsCE.NativeMethods.SetTimeZoneInformation(). Why would the underlying P/Invoke (SetTimeZoneInfo) hang for such a long time?</p>

<p>Our code runs on Windows CE 4.2, and with a much smaller userbase, on Windows CE 5.0 -- the code here is the same between the two versions. So far, I've seen this occur on 4.2 devices but never on 5.0, and even with the smaller number of users on 5.0, I think I would have seen it had it been present there.</p>

<p>The function below is the function from which the problem stems. It converts a time zone abbreviation to its full name, then uses the name to find the right time zone and attempts to set the device's current time zone to that one.</p>

Doesn't have to zoom in and out, or have a background, or anything. </p>

<p>I have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>an iPhone</li>
<li>a MacBook</li>
<li>the iPhone SDK</li>
<li>Blender</li>
</ul>

<p>My knowledge base:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can make 3D models in various 3D programs (I'm most comfortable with 3D Studio Max, which I once took a course on, but I've used others)</li>
<li>General knowledge of procedural programming from years ago (QuickBasic - I'm old!)</li>
<li>Beginner's knowledge of object-oriented programming from going through simple Java and C# tutorials (Head Start C# book and my wife's intro to OOP course that used Java)</li>
<li>I have managed to display a 3D textured model and spin it using a tutorial in C# I got off the net (I didn't just copy and paste, I understand basically how it works) and the XNA game development library, using Visual Studio on Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I do not know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Much about Objective C</li>
<li>Anything about OpenGL or OpenGL ES, which the iPhone apparently uses</li>
<li>Anything about XCode</li>
</ul>

<p>My main problem is that I don't know where to start! All the iPhone books I found seem to be about creating GUI applications, not OpenGL apps. I found an OpenGL book but I don't know how much, if any, applies to iPhone development. And I find the Objective C syntax somewhat confusing, with the weird nested method naming, things like ""id"" that don't make sense, and the scary thought that I have to do manual memory management.</p>

<p>Where is the best place to start? I couldn't find any tutorials for this sort of thing, but maybe my Google-Fu is weak. Or maybe I should start with learning Objective C? I know of books like Aaron Hillgrass', but I've also read that they are outdated and much of the sample code doesn't work on the iPhone SDK, plus it seems geared towards the Model-View-Controller paradigm which doesn't seem that suited for 3D apps.</p>

<p>Basically I'm confused about what my first steps should be. </p>

<p>The probability of hashing collisions is proportional to the loading in a dictionary.  Therefore, even if the dictionary does not resize itself (and uses all of its slots) then the performance must degrade due to these collisions. </p>

The product inventory will be shared between a phyical store and a web store so we will need to periodically update quantity on hand for each product to keep the POS and the web store as close to in synch as possible to avoid over selling product in either location.  The POS system does have an scheduled export that will run every hour.</p>

<p>My question is, has anyone had any experience with synchronizing data with an Able Commerce 7 web store and would you have any advice on an approach?</p>

<p>Here are the approaches that we are currently considering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab exported product data from the POS system and determine which products need to be updated.  Make calls to a custom-built web service residing on the server with AbleCommerce to call AbleCommerce APIs and update the web store appropriately.</li>
<li>Able Commerce does have a Data Port utility that can import/export web store data via the Able Commerce XML format.  This would provide all of the merging logic but there doesn't appear to be a way to programmatically kick off the merge process.  Their utility is a compiled Windows application.  There is no command-line interface that we are aware of.  The Data Port utility calls an ASHX handler on the server.</li>
<li>Take an approach similar to #1 above but attempt to use the Data Port ASHX handler to update the products instead of using our own custom web service.  Currently there is no documentation for interfacing with the ASHX handler that we are aware of.</li>

<p>As I understand perfomance hit is not signifcant with pooling and it allows me to recover from broken connections quite easily (just a new connection will be created) but then again a connection object is a nice, relatively high-level abstraction and creating a new connection for every operation (not SQL command, but application operation) generates additional, duplicated code and feels like a waste of time/resources(?).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This is character-by-character parsing. I am not going to use a GUI. The usual InputStream I/O in Java in console mode requires you to hit the Enter key first (e.g. it's buffered input only). Please don't tell me character-by-character input in console mode is impossible in Java; it isn't. JLine does it using a portable interface with a platform-dependent implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Edit update</strong>: I was able to hack together a helper class to do the blocking I/O in a worker thread (using JLine for the per-character I/O, warning: you have to parse Ctrl-C yourself!) &amp; then communicate via a synchronized queue with an isempty() routine. For what I'm doing right now that's fine, but I would really like to know a Good Way To Do This In The Future.</p>

a syntax error on my part, but the compiler isn't catching. Anyway, 
here is what I'm trying to do. Basically I've written my own 
repository class that essentially just wraps the Fluent Repository 
class. So here is the relevant code: </p>

<pre><code>Public Class GenericRepository(Of T As IHasIntId) 
    Private _fluentRepos As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository 
    Public Sub New(ByVal FluentRepository As 
FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository) 
        _fluentRepos = FluentRepository 
    End Sub 
    Private Sub New() 
    End Sub 
    Public Function GetById(ByVal Id As Integer) As T 
        Return Query(Function(x As T) (x.Id = Id)).FirstOrDefault 
    End Function 
    Public Function Query(ByVal w As Expression(Of System.Func(Of T, 
Boolean))) As IList(Of T) 
        Return _fluentRepos.Query(Of T)(w).ToList() 
    End Function 
End Class 
</code></pre>

<p>Then I wrote two unit tests, one that would pass in an 
InMemoryRepository and one that would use an actual NHibernate session 
to hit the real database. 
here they are: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub InMemoryTest() 
        Dim inmemRepos As New InMemoryRepository() 
        Dim p As New Product() 
        Dim id As Integer = 5 
        p.Id = id 
        p.Title = ""my product"" 
        inmemRepos.Save(p) 
        Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(inmemRepos) 
        Dim foundP = genRepos.GetById(id) 
        Assert.AreEqual(p.Title, foundP.Title) 
    End Sub 

   &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub DatabaseTest() 
        Dim session = NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.GetSession() 
        Dim flRepos As New Repository(session) 
        Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(flRepos) 
        Dim id As Integer = 1 
        Dim p = genRepos.GetById(id) 
        Assert.IsNotNull(p) 
        Assert.AreEqual(id, p.Id) 
    End Sub 
</code></pre>

<p>The InMemoryTest passed, and the DatabaseTest failed. The exception 
from the DatabaseTest was a type conversion, from int to product (or 
maybe the other way around.) I was able to ""fix"" it though. In the 
Fluent NHibernate code I changed the Query method on the Repository 
class from: </p>

<pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where).ToArray(); 
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where.Compile()).ToArray(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Now both tests pass. All of the unit tests in the Fluent NHibernate 
project pass either way.</p>

The database is running on an HP Proliant ML370 G5 server with Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10; I am querying it from my laptop over a private network managed by a simple D-Link router. I assigned static DHCP (private) IPs to both laptop and server.</p>

<p>Anyway, from my laptop, using pgAdmin III, I send off some SQL commands/queries; some of these are CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, DELETE, SELECT, etc. Sometimes I send a command (like CREATE INDEX), it returns, telling me that the query was executed perfectly, etc. However, the postmaster process assigned to such a command seems to remain sleeping on the server. Now, I do not really mind this, for I say to myself that PostgreSQL maintains a pool of postmasters ready to process queries. Yet, if this process eats up 6 GB of it 9.4 GB assigned RAM, I worry (and it does so for the moment). Now maybe this is a cache of data that is kept in [shared] memory in case another query happens to need to use that same data, but I do not know.</p>

<p>Another thing is bothering me. </p>

<p>I have 2 tables. One is the <em>page</em> table; I have an index on its <em>page_id</em> column. The other is the <em>pagelinks</em> tables which has the <em>pl_from</em> column that references either nothing or a variable in the <em>page.page_id</em> column; unlike the <em>page_id</em> column, the <em>pl_from</em> has no index (yet). To give you an idea of the scale of the tables and the necessity for me to find a viable solution, <em>page</em> table has 13.4 million rows (after I deleted those I do not need) while the <em>pagelinks</em> table has 293 million.</p>

<p>I need to execute the following command to clean the <em>pagelinks</em> table of some of its useless rows:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM pagelinks USING page WHERE pl_from NOT IN (page_id);
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, I wish to rid the <em>pagelinks</em> table of all links coming from a page not in the <em>page</em> table. Even after disabling the nested loops and/or sequential scans, the query optimizer always gives me the following ""solution"":</p>

<pre><code>Nested Loop  (cost=494640.60..112115531252189.59 rows=3953377028232000 width=6)
  Join Filter: (""outer"".pl_from &lt;&gt; ""inner"".page_id)""
  -&gt;  Seq Scan on pagelinks  (cost=0.00..5889791.00 rows=293392800 width=17)
  -&gt;  Materialize  (cost=494640.60..708341.51 rows=13474691 width=11)
        -&gt;  Seq Scan on page  (cost=0.00..402211.91 rows=13474691 width=11)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that such a task would take more than weeks to complete; obviously, this is unacceptable. It seems to me that I would much rather it use the <em>page_id</em> index to do its thing...but it is a stubborn optimizer and I might be wrong. </p>

The client has a vision for the application but openly admits to having very few requirements and recognizes that we will have to charge by the hour. Because of this, I've all but sold him on an Agile approach.</p>

<p>The problem is that he wants a figure to budget around. I've read a number of articles that pretty much advocate against giving up an estimate because the client will budget for that number and even as requirements change, the number in their head and in the books doesn't.</p>

<p>I've read there are a number of ways to factor in pricing in the contract, but almost all of them (save one) incorporate an up-front number. This just seems to violate the entire set of principles of Agile development.</p>

<p>So my question is, if you're an Agile shop, how do you manage to circumvent this Catch-22 of Agile development?</p>

We needed validation for the user input for dates, so I have implemented a combination of masking for format validation and parsing for actual date validation. I have done this using a custom CellEditor for the date column.</p>

<p>Inside my MaskedCellEditor, I have a JFormattedTextField. I setup the masking for dates. Then I add an InputVerifier to allow for actual validation. My InputVerifier implements verify() to check: 1. textField.isEditValid() 2. DateValidator.ValidDate(). If either is invalid, verify returns false and the InputVerifier locks the focus into the text field (the cell editor) and a small message dialog is displayed reminding the user of the date format.</p>

<p>The error message is a small, undecorated, non-modal, non-focusable JDialog that pops up underneath the cell being edited. It disappears on a keypress or a successful date verification. It is working great except for a small edge case.</p>

<p>If the user selects a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog, it switches screens, destroying everything currently on the screen (including the table). However, since the dialog is being shown and a keypress/successful edit has not occurred, the dialog is never hidden. It remains visible in a completely unrelated context on a different screen. Once the user has switched off the screen with the table, there is no way for the user to get rid of the dialog.</p>

<p>I have debated throwing either a Timer and/or a MouseListener on the dialog itself that would cause it to disappear, but I feel that I am ignoring the actual problem. The dialog is never being disposed of and I am pretty sure its because it is still set to be visible and it is preventing the garbage collector from getting rid of it.</p>

<p>I have a Cleanup method on the panel holding the JTable, but I cannot find a good way to reference the dialog (a component of the InputVerifier) in order to get rid of it. The dialog is pretty far removed from the table's parent panel. (Panel -> JTable -> CellEditor -> JFormattedTextField -> InputVerifier -> JDialog)</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to force the dialog to be hidden when the table is destroyed? If you need more details, let me know. I'm trying not to get you guys bogged down in the details, but there is a lot going on.</p>

<p>I am part of an organization that ""hosts"" events. For example, we have an annual camp, skating, hocket/soccer tournaments, dinners, and the like.</p>

<p>Now they want me to design their website. My habit is usually to put it on paper first so I am trying to do that. But the problem is here:</p>

<p>They need a registration form. But for every event/activity the questions asked are different. For example for the annual camp, theres a question ""What allergies do you have?"". For the hockey tournament theres a question ""Whats your favourite jersey color"" and ""Name the 5 other people in your team"". *</p>

<p>*note: there are generic questions like name/age/location/phone/email. </p>

<p>Also please keep in mind that these people dont know a thing about web development and how to use it. I know this because I've already made them a website with an admin panel but they still find it too confusing (and also the part where I have to create teh ""custom"" registration form).</p>

<p>I am now thinking of how to incorporate this. Ideally I'd like all this information to go to a database. </p>

<p>My options 
1) Using online registration form to capture generic information. Pass a PDF link but open the PDF in the BROWSER with the ability to write on it. Upon submitting, the newly saved PDF can go to an email. </p>

<p>2) .. well thats all I have right now lol. </p>

<p>Anyone have suggestions/solutions? </p>

Suppose we have a repository with files and directories in it that shouldn't be under version control but rather should be on the ignore list (such as Eclipse files <code>.settings</code>, <code>.project</code>, generated documentation files - things that should never have been added and committed in the first place). What is the best way of deleting these files from the repository and moving them straight onto the ignore list?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
The accepted answer below details a good way of setting up your local subversion repositories to avoid the problem described above. However, if you still have to solve this, it seems that you have to do some manual fiddling to get files/folders out of the repository and onto the ignore list. </p>

<p>For instance, for the <code>.settings</code> folder, first add this to the global ignores list and then run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$REMOVE="".settings""
cp -r ""$REMOVE"" /tmp/ &amp;&amp; \
svn rm ""$REMOVE"" &amp;&amp; \
svn commit -m ""Moving to ignore list"" ""$REMOVE"" &amp;&amp; \ 
mv ""/tmp/$REMOVE"" .
</code></pre>

<p>This copies the file/folder to a temporary location and then removes it from SVN and commits the remove - finally the file/folder is copied back, but as it is now on the ignore list it will be ignored by SVN.</p>

One thing I am mooting is whether or not it is acceptable for a View to cause (indirectly) access to the database?</p>

<p>For example, I am using the controller to populate a custom data class with all the information I think the View needs to go about doing its job, however as I am passing objects to the view it also can cause database reads.</p>

<p>A quick pseudo example.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IProduct
{
    /* Some Members */

    /* Some Methods */
    decimal GetDiscount();
}

public class Product : IProduct
{
    public decimal GetDiscount(){ ... /* causes database access */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the View has access to the Product class (it gets passed an IProduct object), it can call GetDiscount() and cause database access. </p>

<p>I am thinking of ways to prevent this. Currently I am only coming up with multiple interface inheritance for the <code>Product</code> class. Instead of implementing just IProduct it would now implement <code>IProduct</code> and <code>IProductView</code>. IProductView would list the members of the class, IProduct would contain the method calls which could cause database access.</p>

<p>The 'View' will only know about the <code>IProductView</code> interface onto the class and be unable to call methods which cause data access. </p>

<p>I have other vague thoughts about 'locking' an object before it is passed to the view, but I can foresee huge scope for side effects with such a method.</p>

<p>So, My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any best practices regarding this issue? </li>
<li>How do other people using MVC stop the View being naughty and doing more to objects than they should?</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE**
It would appear this works, but if someone could confirm that it is ""proper"" I'd be grateful. So, if I want leaf nodes under a category with Id = 1, I would do this: </p>

<pre><code>Categories.Where( c =&gt; !c.Children.Any ( d =&gt; d.ParentId == c.Id)).Where( e =&gt; e.ParentId == 1)

<p>""Children"" is the name Linq gives the self-referencing association.</p>

I realize that I could just use <code>default=datetime.datetime.utcnow</code>; however, this is a naive time that would happily accept someone passing in a naive localtime-based datetime, even if I used <code>timezone=True</code> with it, because it makes local or UTC time non-naive without having a base timezone to normalize it with.

<p>I've setup a cherrypy upload/POST handler for our receiver end.  I've managed to allow it to do arbitrary number of parameters using multipart/form-data.  However when we try to send the multipart-mixed data, we're not getting any processing.</p>

<pre><code>@cherrypy.expose
def upload(self, *args,**kwargs):
    """"""upload adapted from cherrypy tutorials

    We use our variation of cgi.FieldStorage to parse the MIME
    encoded HTML form data containing the file.""""""

    print args   
    print kwargs

    cherrypy.response.timeout = 1300

    lcHDRS = {}
    for key, val in cherrypy.request.headers.iteritems():
        lcHDRS[key.lower()] = val
    incomingBytes = int(lcHDRS['content-length'])

    print cherrypy.request.rfile 

    #etc..etc...
</code></pre>

<p>So, when submitting multipart/form-data, args and kwargs are well defined.<br>
args are the form fields, kwargs=hash of vars and values.
When I submit multipart/mixed, args and kwargs are empty, and I just have cherrypy.request.rfile as the raw POST information.  </p>

<p>My question is, does cherrypy have a built in handler to handle multipart/mixed and chunked encoding for POST?  Or will I need to override the cherrypy.tools.process_request_body and roll my own decoder?</p>

<p>It seems like the builtin wsgi server with cherrypy handles this as part of the HTTP/1.1 spec, but I could not seem to find documentation in cherrypy in accessing this functionality.</p>

<hr>

<p>...to clarify</p>

<p>I'm using latest version 3.1.1 or so of Cherrypy.</p>

<p>Making a default form just involves making parameters in the upload function.</p>

<p>For the multipart/form-data, I've been calling curl -F param1=@file1.jpg -F param2=sometext -F param3=@file3.wav <a href=""http://destination:port/upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://destination:port/upload</a></p>

<p>In that example, I get:</p>

<pre><code>args = ['param1','param2','param3] 
kwargs = {'param1':CString&lt;&gt;, 'param2': 'sometext', 'param3':CString&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to submit the multipart/mixed, I tried looking at the request.body, but kept on getting None for that, regardless of setting the body processing.</p>

<p>The input we're getting is coming in as this:</p>

<pre><code>user-agent:UNTRUSTED/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1
content-language:en-US
content-length:565719
mime-version:1.0
content-type:multipart/mixed; boundary='newdivider'
host:192.168.1.1:8180
transfer-encoding:chunked



--newdivider
Content-type: text/xml

&lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;&lt;data&gt;&lt;Stuff&gt;....
etc...etc...

--newdivider
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-ID: file://localhost/root1/photos/Garden.jpg
Content-transfer-encoding: binary

&lt;binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that the multipart/mixed is the problem that cherrypy is just giving me just the rfile. Our goal is to have cherrypy process the body into its parts with minimal processing on the receive side (ie, let cherrypy do its magic). If that requires us being tougher on the sending format to be a content-type that cherrypy likes, then so be it. What are the accepted formats? Is it only multipart/form-data?</p>

So far the best way I've come up with doing this is to implement a generic Optimistic which will store a copy of the original and any changes (so it will store two copies: the original and modified) of any value object that can be modified. Is this the best way of doing it?</p>

<p>For example: a UserVO will be wrapped by the generic as a Optimistic. When a change is made to the Optimistic, the change will be made to the modified copy stored in the Optimistic while the original also stored in the Optimistic will remain intact. The main issue seems to be that it will use up twice the space and hence bandwidth.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The solution needs to be database independent, and it would be useful to be able to specify an conflict resolution policy per value object. (eg. A user object might try and merge if the updated rows weren't changed, but a transaction object would always require user intervention).</p>

I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>#content-text {

    padding-left: 10px;
    padding-right:10px;
    text-align: left;
    color:#000;

    margin-left: 25px;
    margin-right:25px;

<p>The odd thing, is that while this code actually does what I want in IE in Firefox it overflows and becomes a scrollbar. I've tried overflow:auto; overflow:hidden; and overflow:inherit; just to see if any helped but no luck so far, and I honestly have no idea of why is this happening in Firefox, =/ would any of you know?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
I tried with overflow:visible; but I just get the overflow...well visible but still it doesn't wraps. and ONLY in Firefox so far. =/</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
The only other thing that could be affecting is that I have another CSS code and the first is contained:</p>

<pre><code>#content-title{
    background-color: transparent;
    background-image: url(../img/content-title-body.png);
    background-repeat: repeat-y;
    background-attachment: scroll;
    background-x-position: 0%;
    background-y-position: 0%;
    height:auto;
    position:absolute;
    z-index :100; /* ensure the content-title is on top of navigation area */
    width:1026px;/*1050px*/
    margin: 160px 100px 5px 100px;
    overflow: visible;
    top: 55px;
}

<p>and the HTML that uses this is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""content-title""&gt;

<p>Now, for the problem...despite having 8 entries in the text file this is being read from, the map only ever gets up to 2 entries. Once one entry (key) is entered, it STAYS, but the VALUE changes with every iteration of the scanning process (every time it reads in a new vector from a line in the file). It throws out all the other keys except for the two.</p>

<p>Is this a problem with my comparator? Or is the TreeMap doing something I don't understand with put()?</p>

Currently it is written in COBOL and is a communication application. It sends a fixed length record via the web and recieves a fixed length record back. I would like to write it as a structure for simplicity, but so far the best thing I have found is a method that uses string.padright to put the string terminator in the correct place.</p>

<p>I could write a class that encapsulates this and returns a fixed length string, but I'm hoping to find a simple way to fill a structure and use it as a fixed length record.</p>

<p>edit--</p>

<p>The fixed length record is used as a parameter in a URL, so its http:\somewebsite.com\parseme?record=""firstname     lastname     address      city        state      zip"". I'm pretty sure I won't have to worry about ascii to unicode conversions since it's in a url. It's a little larger than that and more information is passed than address, about 30 or 35 fields.</p>

It essentially looks like this (shortened for brevity to only show one application):</p>

<pre><code>using System.IO;
using System.Configuration;
public static class ExternalApplications
{

   public string App1Path
   {
      get
      {
         if(null == thisApp1Path)
            thisApp1Path = Configuration.AppSettings.Get(""App1Path"");
         return thisApp1Path;
      }
   }
   private string thisApp1Path = null;

   public bool App1Exists() 
   {
      if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(App1Path))
         throw new ConfigurationException(""App1Path not specified."");
      return File.Exists(App1Path);
   }

   public void ExecuteApp1(string args) 
   {
       // Code to launch the application.
   }

}
</code></pre>

<p>It's a nice attempt to separate the external applications from the rest of the code, but it occurs to me that this could have been refactored further. What I have in mind is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>using System.IO;
public abstract class ExternalApplicationBase
{

   protected ExternalApplicationBase()
   {
      InitializeFromConfiguration();
   }

   public string Path { get; protected set; }

   public bool Exists() 
   {
      if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.Path))
         throw new ConfigurationException(""Path not specified."");
      return File.Exists(this.Path);
   }

   public virtual void Execute(string args)
   {
      // Implementation to launch the application
   } 

   protected abstract InitializeFromConfiguration();

}

public class App1 : ExternalApplicationBase
{

   protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration()
   {
      // Implementation to initialize this application from
      // the application's configuration file.
   }

 }

 public class App2 : ExternalApplicationBase
 {

   protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration()
   {
      // Implementation to initialize this application from
      // the application's configuration file.
   }

 }
</code></pre>

<p>My concerns are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A class, interface, or other construct may already exist that does this, and I just haven't stumbled across it.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be overkill for what I want to do. Note, however, that the application uses at least three separate 3rd party applications that I have identified so far (and more are almost certain to pop up). </p></li>
<li><p>I'm not entirely comfortable with the name of the base class. It seems fuzzy, and not very informative (but I couldn't think of much better, given that Application is already well defined, reserved by the Framework, and would create a gross level of confusion were I to use it).</p></li>
<li><p>The idea is that I want to be able to keep the application configuration data (it's path and executable name) in the App.Config file, and check for its existence when my application starts up; when my software needs to launch the software, I want to do it through a single method call, and not have the code building command lines and trying to launch the software manually (as it currently does).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I'm sending out a request for help, guidance, and suggestions. Anything you can profer is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm asking this here because I work, as I frequently do, as a sole developer at my firm; I don't have anyone else to bounce these ideas off of. You guys have tons of experience with this stuff, and it would be foolish of me not to ask for your advice, so I hope you'll all bear with me. Thanks in advance!</p>

The general message from the blog post was that you shouldn't ask people what they use, you should track it for yourself.</p>

<p>This leads to an unfortunate chicken-and-egg situation when trying to figure out what new feature to add next. Without the feature already in place, I can't measure how much it's actually being used. With finite (and severely stretched) resources, I also can't afford to add all the features and then remove the unused ones.</p>

<p><strong>How do you find out what will be useful to your users?</strong> If a survey is the only option, do you have to structure your questions in certain ways (eg: don't show a list of possible features, since that would be leading them on)?</p>

<hr>

<p>Next, I extracted the files and installed each package with:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -i filename.deb
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the following files located in /usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1:</p>

<ul>
<li>libNxCharacter.so</li>
<li>libNxCooking.so</li>
<li>libPhysXCore.so</li>
<li>libNxCharacter.so.1</li>
<li>libNxCooking.so.1</li>
<li>libPhysXCore.so.1</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Next, I created symbolic links to /usr/lib:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1/libNxCharacter.so.1 /usr/lib/libNxCharacter.so.1
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1/libNxCooking.so.1 /usr/lib/libNxCooking.so.1
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1/libPhysXCore.so.1 /usr/lib/libPhysXCore.so.1

<hr>

<p>Now, using Eclipse, I have specified the following libraries (-l):</p>

<ul>
<li>libNxCharacter.so.1</li>
<li>libNxCooking.so.1</li>
<li>libPhysXCore.so.1</li>
</ul>

<p>And the following search paths just in case (-L):</p>

<ul>
<li>/usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1</li>
<li>/usr/lib</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, as Gerald Kaszuba suggested, I added the following include paths (-I):</p>

<ul>
<li>/usr/lib/PhysX/v2.8.1</li>
<li>/usr/lib</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Then, I attempted to compile the following code:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""NxPhysics.h""

NxPhysicsSDK* gPhysicsSDK = NULL;
NxScene* gScene = NULL;
NxVec3 gDefaultGravity(0,-9.8,0);

void InitNx()
{
    gPhysicsSDK = NxCreatePhysicsSDK(NX_PHYSICS_SDK_VERSION);

    if (!gPhysicsSDK)
    {
        std::cout&lt;&lt;""Error""&lt;&lt;std::endl;
        return;
    }

    NxSceneDesc sceneDesc;
    sceneDesc.gravity = gDefaultGravity;
    gScene = gPhysicsSDK-&gt;createScene(sceneDesc);
}

int main(int arc, char** argv)
{
    InitNx();

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first error I get is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NxPhysics.h: No such file or directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which tells me that the project is obviously not linking properly.  Can anyone tell me what I have done wrong, or what else I need to do to get my project to compile?  I am using the GCC C++ Compiler.  Thanks in advance!</p>

Option one, have fewer items in the cache which are more complex, or many items which are less complex.</p>

<p>For sake of discussion lets imagine my site has SalesPerson and Customer objects. These are pretty simple classes but I don’t want to be chatty with the database so I want to lazy load them into cache and invalidate them out of the cache when I make a change – simple enough.</p>

<p>Option 1
Create Dictionary and cache the entire dictionary. When I need to load an instance of a SalesPerson from the cache I get out the Dictionary and perform a normal key lookup against the Dictionary. </p>

<p>Option 2
Prefix the key of each item and store it directly in the asp.net cache. For example every SalesPerson instance in the cache would use a composite of the prefix plus the key for that object so it may look like sp_[guid] and is stored in the asp.net cache and also in the cache are the Customer objects with a  key like cust_[guid].</p>

<p>One of my fears with option two is that the numbers of entries will grow very large, between SalesPerson, Customer and a dozen or so other categories I might have 25K items in cache and highly repetitive lookups for something like a string resource that I am using in several places might pay a penalty while the code looks through the cache’s key collection to find it amongst the other 25K.</p>

<p>I am sure at some point there is a diminishing return here on storing too many items in the cache but I am curious as to opinions on these matters.</p>

It's an unobtrusive tag based framework for wiring up events between models, views and delegates in a GUI system. </p>

<p>Basically you have one large json file which is used describes all of the events, event handlers and bindings. The user creates their models, views and delegates all of which have no knowledge of the framework. The JSON file is passed to an init() methods, then the framework creates all of the instances needed and takes care of all the bindings, listeners etc.</p>

<p>The problems I have are two fold:</p>

<p>1) There is basically only a single public method in the framework, everything else is communicated through the mark-up in the JSON file. Therefore I have a very small testing surface for what is a large and complicated application.</p>

<p>2) One of the big roles of the application is to instantiate class's if they haven't been instantiated previously and cached. This means that I need real classes in my test code, simple mocks aren't going to cut it.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm considering a couple if solutions. The first is start testing the private methods. The second is to just stub the constructors.</p>

<p>Any one else have any ideas? </p>

Both techniques provide a compile-time, rapid-response check for certain kinds of errors in your program. However, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that a unit test suite with full coverage would test everything static type checking would test, and then some. Or phrased another way, static type checks only go part of the way to ""prove"" that your program is correct, whereas unit tests will let you ""prove"" as much as you want (to a certain extent).</p>

<p>So, is there any reason to use a language with static type checking if you're using unit testing as well? A somewhat similar question was asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/236407/python-for-large-scale-development"">here</a>, but I'd like to get into more detail. What specific advantages, if any, does static type checking have over unit tests? A few issues like compiler optimizations and intellisense come to mind, but are there other solutions for those problems? Are there other advantages/disadvantages I haven't thought of?</p>

It's not working, and I don't know how to resolve it, and hey, that's what StackOverflow is for, right?</p>

<p>Firstly, the error message is:</p>

<pre><code>Error: element.dispatchEvent is not a function
Source File: http://.../wp-includes/js/prototype.js?ver=1.6
Line: 3936
</code></pre>

<p>It happens on page load. My page load handler is registered thusly:</p>

<pre><code>Event.observe(window, 'load', show_dates_as_local_time);
</code></pre>

<p>The error goes away if I disable some other plugins, and this (plus googling) led me to conclude that it was a conflict between prototype and jQuery (which is used by some of the other plugins).</p>

<p>Secondly I'm following the wordpress recommended practice of using <a href=""http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>wp_enqeue_script</code></a> to add a dependency from my JavaScript to the Prototype library, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'wp_print_scripts', 'depo_theme_add_javascript' );

function depo_theme_add_javascript() {
    wp_enqueue_script('friendly_dates', 'javascript/friendly_dates.js', array('prototype'));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm also aware that there are some potential conflicts between jQuery and Prototype which are resolved using the jQuery <code>noConflicts</code> method. I've tried calling that from various places but no good. I don't <em>think</em> this is the problem because a) the <code>noConflict</code> function relates solely to the <code>$</code> variable, which doesn't seem to be the problem here, and b) I would <em>expect</em> wordpress to sort it out for me because it can...</p>

<p>Lastly, using the Venkman debugger I've determined that the <code>element</code> referenced in the error message is indeed an <code>HTMLDocument</code> but also does lack a <code>dispatchEvent</code>. Not sure how this could happen, given it's a standard DOM method?</p>

The class keeps a dictionary of all its instances and when somebody requests a new instance, the class tries to satisfy the request from the cache first. There is a small problem with memory management though: The dictionary cache retains the inserted objects, so that they never get deallocated. I do want them to get deallocated, so that I had to overload the <code>release</code> method and when the retain count drops to one, I can remove the instance from cache and let it get deallocated.</p>

<p>This works, but I am not comfortable mucking around the <code>release</code> method and find the solution overly complicated. I thought I could use some hashing class that does not retain the objects it stores. Is there such? The idea is that when the last user of a certain instance releases it, the instance would automatically disappear from the cache.</p>

<p><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSHashTable_class/Introduction/Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NSHashTable</a> seems to be what I am looking for, but the documentation talks about “supporting weak relationships in a garbage-collected environment.” Does it also work without garbage collection?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Clarification:</em> I cannot afford to keep the instances in memory unless somebody really needs them, that is why I want to purge the instance from the cache when the last “real” user releases it.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Better solution:</em> This was on the iPhone, I wanted to cache some textures and on the other hand I wanted to free them from memory as soon as the last real holder released them. The easier way to code this is through another class (let’s call it <code>TextureManager</code>). This class manages the texture instances and caches them, so that subsequent calls for texture with the same name are served from the cache. There is no need to purge the cache immediately as the last user releases the texture. We can simply keep the texture cached in memory and when the device gets short on memory, we receive the low memory warning and can purge the cache. This is a better solution, because the caching stuff does not pollute the <code>Texture</code> class, we do not have to mess with <code>release</code> and there is even a higher chance for cache hits. The <code>TextureManager</code> can be abstracted into a <code>ResourceManager</code>, so that it can cache other data, not only textures.</p>

In many of them even twice - in the version tag of the artefact itself and in the version tag of the parent. Thus, you have to change and check in new versions of all pom.xml on every version switch. This is somewhat annoying, especially if you have to code for several bug fixing and a development version in parallel. Is there a way around that?</p>

<p>CLARIFICATION: My question is about the many versions of every single pom.xml that you get over time in your source control system that differ only by the version number of the pom and / or the version number of the parent pom. Ideally, you should only need to change the pom whenever you add a dependency or something.</p>

<p>For example you have a project with the artifacts foo-pom (the parent pom to all), foobar-jar, foobaz-jar and foo-war. In the first release the version is 1.0 - which appears in every pom.xml. In the second release the version is 1.1 - which again appears in every pom.xml. So you have to change every pom.xml - this is annoying if you release as often as you should.</p>

<p>UPDATE: If you think this is important: not having to specify the parent version is already being considered. Please go to the <a href=""http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-624"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maven JIRA issue</a> and vote for it to get it more noticed and more likely to be added as an enhancement in an upcoming release. You need to create/have a JIRA login for that.</p>

I needed to display locale characters and have them recognized as characters, so I just quickly monkey-patched few functions / methods from curses module. </p>

<p>This was what I call a fast and ugly solution, even if it works. And the changes were relativly small, so I can hope I haven't messed up anything. My plan was to find another solution, but seeing it works and works well, you know how it is, I went forward to other problems I had to deal with, and I'm sure if there's no bug in this I won't ever make it better.</p>

<p>The more general question appeared to me though - obviously some languages allow us to monkey-patch large chunks of code inside classes. If this is the code I only use for myself, or the change is small, it's ok. What if some other developer takes my code though, he sees that I use some well-known module, so he can assume it works as it's used to. Then, this method suddenly behaves diffrent then it should. </p>

<p>So, very subjective, should we use monkey patching, and if yes, when and how? How should we document it? </p>

<hr>

<p>edit: for @guerda:</p>

<p>Monkey-patching is the ability to dynamicly change the behavior of some piece of code at the execution time, without altering the code itself.</p>

<p>A small example in Python:</p>

<pre><code>import os
def ld(name):
    print(""The directory won't be listed here, it's a feature!"")

os.listdir = ld

# now what happens if we call os.listdir(""/home/"")?
os.listdir(""/home/"")

I would like to choose the path $JBOSS_HOME/$DEPLOY/myEAR.ear/myWAR.war/WhateverLocationHere/</p>

<p>However, I don't know how I can programatically choose path without giving an absolute path, or setting $JBOSS_HOME and $DEPLOY.</p>

<pre>Anybody know how I can do this?</pre>

<p>The second question;
I want to easily preview these generated files. Either through JavaScript, or whatever is the easiest way. However, JavaScript cannot access the filesystem on the server, so I cannot open the file through JavaScript.</p>

<pre>Any easy solutions out there?</pre>

<p>However I am told that the absence of a DocType at the top of said HTML is causing both both browsers to work in ""Quirks"" mode.</p>

<p>I am told this is bad.</p>

<p>I have tried several DocTypes but have not found a DocType/HTML combination which yields a correct rendering in both browsers.</p>

<p>Anything other than ""Quirks"" mode causes the browsers to react differently to the attempt to set the width of a textbox. This seems to lead to a position where I can correct my instructions for either FF or IE and suddenly the other will fail. </p>

<p>Some detail...</p>

<p>1.> The objective here is that the 3 rows should appear to be the same width exactly when rendered in each browser. It is not nessecary that the rendered widths are the same across browsers, merely that they appear correctly justified/alighned inside each browser.</p>

<p>2.> The image referenced is a spacer image 3 pixels wide and 1 high (an alternative to this would also be good)</p>

<p>3.> I do not want to introduce tables if at all possible.</p>

<p>It seems as though the Quirks mode is the only mode which is consistent across the browsers. I am worried however that the final version of IE8 or indeed in some future browser, the quirks mode will not be the default.</p>

<p><strong>What should I do ? How do specify a DocType (and maybe alter my html) which will create a consistent look across browsers?</strong></p>

<p>The plan is that a <a href=""http://jtemplates.tpython.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jTemplates</a> template contains the fields, my plugin looks through the template to find any required multi-lingual resources, requests them from the server, and then packages everything up into a JavaScript object that is then passed to a custom function on ""submit"".</p>

<p>Everything is working nicely, except the standard ""when enter is pressed, submit the form"" code that you need to do when you're faking a form:</p>

<pre><code>opts.coreElement.find('input[type=text]').keypress(function(evt) {
    if ((evt.keyCode || evt.which) == 13) {
        opts.coreElement.find('.saveButton').click();
    }
});

<p>The issue is that in Firefox (at least; I haven't checked other browsers yet), if you've entered information in a similarly-named textbox before, you get your form history.  If you then select one of those suggested values by hitting enter, it submits the form.  Not great if you're on the first input on the page.  Really rather annoying, actually.</p>

<p>The obvious solution seems to be to insert a form element around the fields and stopping any possible submission of this dummy form via jQuery.  Fortunately I have the luxury of doing this as I'm in ASP.NET MVC, but what if I wasn't?  What if my plugin didn't know whether it was already inside a form and so had to keep itself to itself?  What if I was in standard WebForms ASP.NET and I <em>had</em> to manually ""target"" each input's return key to the correct submit button?</p>

<p>Is there a way, perhaps through the event object itself, to detect the context of the keypress, so I can filter out the selection of form history items?</p>

<p>The book doesn't really explain this. Can somebody give me a clear explanation of what's going on here? I don't understand why it doesn't print something like:</p>

<p>Clarification:
This question is not about urlencoding non-ASCII characters with the percent notation. It's about the distiction that unicode represents text and byte strings represent a way to encode this text into a sequence of bytes. In Python (prior to 3.0) this distinction is between the unicode and the str types. In MySQL it is TEXT to BLOBS. So the concepts seem to correspond between programming language and database.

I say half-answered because I left it in a condition where I had all the points in the bitmap sorted by mass and left it to the reader to filter the list removing points from the same cluster. </p>

<p>Then when thinking about that step I found that the solution didn't jump out at me like I thought it would. So now I'm asking you guys for help. We have a list of points with masses like so (a Python list of tuples, but you can represent it as you see fit in any language):</p>

<pre><code>[ (6, 2, 6.1580555555555554),
  (2, 1, 5.4861111111111107),
  (1, 1, 4.6736111111111107),
  (1, 4, 4.5938888888888885),
  (2, 0, 4.54),
  (1, 5, 4.4480555555555554),
  (4, 7, 4.4480555555555554),
  (5, 7, 4.4059637188208614),
  (4, 8, 4.3659637188208613),
  (1, 0, 4.3611111111111107),
  (5, 8, 4.3342191043083904),
  (5, 2, 4.119574829931973),
  ...
  (8, 8, 0.27611111111111108),
  (0, 8, 0.24138888888888888) ]
</code></pre>

<p>Each tuple is of the form:</p>

<pre><code>(x, y, mass)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the list is sorted here. If your solution prefers to not have them sorted it's perfectly OK.</p>

<p>The challenge, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/411837/finding-clusters-of-mass-in-a-matrix-bitmap"">if you recall</a>, is to find the main clusters of mass. The number of clusters is not known. But you know the dimensions of the bitmap. Sometimes several points within a cluster has more mass than the center of the next (in size) cluster. So what I want to do is go from the higher-mass points and remove points in the same cluster (points nearby).</p>

<p>When I tried this I ended up having to walk through parts of the list over and over again. I have a feeling I'm just stupid about it. How would you do it? Pseudo code or real code. Of course, if you can just take off where I left in that answer with Python code it's easier for me to experiment with it. </p>

<p>Next step is to figure out how many clusters there really are in the bitmap. I'm still struggling with defining that problem so I might return with a question about it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I should clarify that I know that there's no ""correct"" answer to this question. And the name of the question is key. Phase one of the my clustering is done. <strong>Im in search of a fast, accurate-""enough"" method of filtering away nearby points.</strong> </p>

<p>Let me know if you see how I can make the question clearer.</p>

The data set is time stamped data values with a named primary key. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Name: A|B|C:D
Value: 124
TimeStamp: 01/06/2009 08:24:39,223
</code></pre>

<p>Could be a stock price at a given point in time, so it is, I suppose, a classic time series data pattern. However, I really need a generic RDBMS solution which will work with any reasonable JDBC compatible database as I would like to use Hibernate. Consequently, time series extensions to databases like Oracle are not really an option as I would like the implementor to be able to use their own JDBC/Hibernate capable database.</p>

<p>The challenge here is simply the massive volume of data that can accumulate in a short period of time. So far, my implementations are focused around defining periodical rollup and purge schedules where raw data is aggregated into DAY, WEEK, MONTH etc. tables, but the downside is the early loss of granularity and the slight inconvenience of period mismatches between periods stored in different aggregates.</p>

<p>The challenge has limited options since there is an absolute limit to how much data can be physically compressed while retaining the original granularity of the data, and this limit is exacerbated by the directive of using a relational database, and a generic JDBC capable one at that. </p>

<p>Borrowing a notional concept from classic data compression algorithms, and leveraging the fact that many consecutive values for the same named key can expected to be identical, I am wondering if there is way I can seamlessly reduce the number of stored records by  conflating repeating values into one logical row while also storing a counter that indicates, effectively, ""the next <strong>n</strong> records have the same value"". The implementation of just that seems simple enough, but the trade off is that the data model is now hideously complicated to query against using standard SQL, especially when using any sort of aggregate SQL functions. This significantly reduces the usefulness of the data store since only complex custom code can restore the data back to a ""decompressed"" state resulting in an impedance mismatch with hundreds of tools that will not be able to render this data properly.</p>

<p>I considered the possibility of defining custom Hibernate types that would basically ""understand"" the compressed data set and blow it back up and return query results with the dynamically created synthetic rows. (The database will be read only to all clients except the tightly controlled input stream). Several of the tools I had in mind will integrate with Hibernate/POJOS in addition to raw JDBC  (eg. JasperReports) But this does not really address the aggregate functions issue and probably has a bunch of other issues as well.</p>

<p>So I am part way to resigning myself to possibly having to use a more proprietary [possibly non-SQL] data store (any suggestions appreciated) and then focus on the possibly less complex task of writing a pseudo JDBC driver to at least ease integration with external tools. </p>

<p>I heard reference to something called a ""<em>bit packed file</em>"" as a mechanism to achieve this data compression, but I do not know of any databases that supply this and the last thing I want to do (or can do, really....) is write my own database.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or insight ?</p>

I am loading an assembly using Assembly.LoadFrom, where the assembly is located in a folder which is not the execution folder. </p>

<p>Later on in my test code when I try to load once again this assembly with Assembly.Load, the load fails with a System.IO.FileNotFoundException (“Could not load file or assembly…”) despite the fact that the assembly is already loaded. The load fails both with the strong name and the non-strong name (the original reason for loading once again this assembly is a usage of a BinaryFormatter).</p>

<p>However, in case the assembly is located in the execution folder the later load succeeds in both cases, with the strong name and the non-strong name. In this case you can see that two identical assemblies are loaded from two different locations.</p>

<p>Assembly assembly1 = Assembly.LoadFrom(@""C:\a.dll"");</p>

<p>// Loading with a strong-name fails
Assembly assembly2 = Assembly.Load(@""a, Version=1.0.0.0,

<p>Can I append strings of same group and compare, which is only one comparison
   say <code>( str11 append str12 append str13 )  eqauls ( str21 append str22 append str23 )</code></p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>Should I go for individual 3 comparisons?</p>

<pre><code>if( str11 equals str21 ) {

    if( str12 equals str22 ) {

        if( str13 equals str23 ) {

        }

    }

}

Lets us assume all strings are of same( approx ) length.</p>

For example:</p>

<pre><code>new System.Timers.Timer(1000d / 20);
</code></pre>

<p>yields a timer that fires 16 times per second, not 20.</p>

<p>To be sure that there are no side-effects from too long event handlers, I wrote this little test program:</p>

<pre><code>int[] frequencies = { 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 200, 500 };

// Test System.Timers.Timer
foreach (int frequency in frequencies)
{
    int count = 0;

    // Initialize timer
    System.Timers.Timer timer = new System.Timers.Timer(1000d / frequency);
    timer.Elapsed += delegate { Interlocked.Increment(ref count); };

    // Count for 10 seconds
    DateTime start = DateTime.Now;
    timer.Enabled = true;
    while (DateTime.Now &lt; start + TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
        Thread.Sleep(10);
    timer.Enabled = false;

    // Calculate actual frequency
    Console.WriteLine(
        ""Requested frequency: {0}\nActual frequency: {1}\n"",
        frequency, count / 10d);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>

<p>Requested: 5 Hz; actual: 4,8 Hz<br>
Requested: 10 Hz; actual: 9,1 Hz<br>
Requested: 15 Hz; actual: 12,7 Hz<br>
Requested: 20 Hz; actual: 16 Hz<br>
Requested: 30 Hz; actual: 21,3 Hz<br>
Requested: 50 Hz; actual: 31,8 Hz<br>
Requested: 75 Hz; actual: 63,9 Hz<br>
Requested: 100 Hz; actual: 63,8 Hz<br>
Requested: 200 Hz; actual: 63,9 Hz<br>
Requested: 500 Hz; actual: 63,9 Hz</p>

<p>The actual frequency deviates by up to 36% from the requested one. (And evidently cannot exceed 64 Hz.) Given that Microsoft recommends this timer for its ""greater accuracy"" over <code>System.Windows.Forms.Timer</code>, this puzzles me.</p>

<p>Btw, these are not random deviations. They are the same values every time.
And a similar test program for the other timer class, <code>System.Threading.Timer</code>, shows the exact same results.</p>

<p>In my actual program, I need to collect measurements at precisely 50 samples per second. This should not yet require a real-time system. And it is very frustrating to get 32 samples per second instead of 50.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>@Chris:
You are right, the intervals all seem to be integer multiples of something around 1/64th second. Btw, adding a Thread.Sleep(...) in the event handler doesn't make any difference. This makes sense given that <code>System.Threading.Timer</code> uses the thread pool, so each event is fired on a free thread.</p>

When I trace the error to a specific line of code and comment out that line or replace it with different code to the same effect (e.g. by copying code that would otherwise be called via a function directly to the calling site), the error will appear to go away - typically only to reoccur a couple of (equally inconspicuous looking) statements later.</p>

<p>When running this inside the Delphi debugger I can see that the freezes are often preceded by Access Violations in <code>GetMem.inc</code> . At least all of these issues are 100% reproducible...</p>

<p>Needless to say we had none of these issues when compiling these addins in Delphi 2007.</p>

<p>Now, I'm quite at a loss. I know I have just been lucky but even though I consider myself a fairly experienced programmer (though mostly in niche areas) I never really had to deal with this class of error before. As the title of this question says, I don't even really know where to start. I can step through the code as much as I like but the endless assembler statements mean nothing to me and neither am I proficient in effectively using the CPU view.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I don't even know for sure yet whether this is an issue with my own code to begin with (I actually tend to doubt it in this case). We are makign massive use of a number of third-party libraries (e.g. JCL, ADX, Redemption). ADX in particular still labels its Delphi 2009 support ""beta"".</p>

<p>I also tried using FastMM's FullDebugMode and indeed I did uncover a number of errors in ADX that way (e.g. blocks that were modified after having been freed) but all of these also occur when I compile with Delphi 2007 so it doesn't yet seem imperative that these are ultimately the cause for the observed regression.</p>

<p>So, how do I deal with this? - or better yet: Where can I find some good resources on learning how to deal with this? e.g. tutorials on using the CPU view or effectively interpreting and acting upon the reports put out by FastMM? Are these the correct tools at all? Where else should I look?</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong><br>
What types of code should I be suspicious of in this context? What kind of code even has the potential to wreak such havoc in memory? The only places I can think of where my code performs anything remotely approaching explicit memory manipulation is when reserving some buffer space in preparation of a WinAPI call. Also keep in mind that all of my code is identical between the Delphi 2007 and Delphi 2009 versions and the Delphi 2007 version exhibits no such problems.</p>

With some probability the issue that prompted me to post this question has now been solved. See my own answer below.</p>

4          3        19
5          5        20

<p>I need a query that will show <strong>ALL ACTIVE</strong> Entities and their schedule information for a particular ScheduleYearID.</p>

<p>Output should look like (the desired SchedulingYearID in this case is 20):</p>

1        1
2        3
4        NULL
5        5

<p>My problem is that using this query it will not include active entities without schedule information (such as EntityID 4 in the example above). I can write the query to display all active entities and their schedule status fine, but once I start limiting it via the SchedulingYearID I lose those particular entities. </p>

<p>Are there any solutions that I am obviously missing without having to resort to subqueries, cursors, etc.? If not it's not a big deal, I just feel like I am missing something simple here.</p>

The problem I'm facing is that I'm not so sure how to handle the interaction with my controller and different view classes.</p>

<p>For instance, I've an article by Sun on <a href=""http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/mvc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java App. design with MVC</a>, where they list the option to let all the communications between model and view go through the controller as the most modern one, a tactic I've been taught as well and should do just fine. However, it doesn't quite go as deep as to explain how to handle all the ActionListeners involved for all the elements and different panels. </p>

<p>The 'way to go' I've been taught so far is to either use one controller and set the ActionListener to the various objects through getters and keep track of the active panel. The alternative my awesome Java book gives is to just stick to inner classes for each view class. Either method seems to result in pretty nasty code, while I'd prefer one or several controllers with as little bloat as possible.</p>

<p>My question of course is; how would you assign the ActionListeners as neatly and efficiently as possible while keeping the controller(s) usable?</p>

<p>Note that the sum is not looping (ie. I do not consider <code>last^first</code>) and order is important <code>(2^3 != 3^2)</code> and also <code>a^b</code> could be any function operating over any number of consecutive elements.</p>

<p>Is there a name for such an algorithm and is there established ways of implementing it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have reworded the question since I had incorrectly labeled this as a sorting problem. As pointed out, this is more of an optimization problem.</p>

Ideally, just the letters would get squished or made thinner, leaving the space between words more or less the same. I know there are some CSS attributes that do things like this, but they are more focused on spacing between the letters and not so much on the widths of the letters themselves. These CSS methods are also not very cross-browser friendly. The majority of the user base is using IE6, so that puts a large restriction on CSS-based methods out of the blocks.</p>

<p>So, is there any way to control the character width/spacing that is cross-browser friendly? I know jQuery works across browsers quite well, so could this perhaps be done with jQuery by manipulating the location of the letters and possibly their widths? These are small bits of text, 5 words at a time, or so, so speed is something that can be dealt with later.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Ok, so, the CSS letter-spacing property, as well as the word-spacing property will allow me to control the space between letters/words. However, this makes things look squished. If this truly is the only option, then I'll have to make it work, but what I am really looking for is a way to squish the letters themselves, to make the characters thinner.</p>

A typical example is a login DAO where you usually have a field that characterises the user as ""NORMAL"" or ""ADMIN"". In Hibernate, I would use the following 2 objects to represent this relationship in a (semi-)typesafe way:</p>

<pre><code>class User {
    String username;
    String passwd;
    UserType type;
}

class UserType {
    private enum Type {ADMIN, NORMAL};

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Name
        &lt;span class=""small""&gt;Add your name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" name=""textfield"" id=""textfield"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p></p>

<p>I am wondering how I go about including the span's content (say a variable such as 'warning')</p>

<p>I have tried all sorts, to no avail. The methods call ok (such as f.text_field :name will produce </p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=""object_name""&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Have tried this:</p>

<pre><code>  def self.create_tagged_field(method_name)
    define_method(method_name) do |label, warning, *args|
      @template.content_tag(""p"",
        @template.content_tag(""label"" , 
                              label.to_s.humanize.capitalize+
                              content_tag(""span"", warning), 
                              :for =&gt; ""#{@object_name}_#{label}"") 
                               +
        super)
    end

<p>But no luck. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? Thanks, A</p>

exporting some data to a software called HFM (Oracle Hyperion Financial Management).
To perform that export, the .net application uses an API based on COM objects provided by the HFM client (the client is installed on the same machine that the server, etc.)</p>

<p>My problem is that the API provides a method to connect to the HFM server but not to disconnect.<br>
The documentation says that to disconnect, the application must call the method <strong>Marshal.ReleaseComObject()</strong> on each COM object created.
But there are a lot of complex actions performed and I am not able to release all created object.<br>
So my application doesn't disconnect.</p>

<p>I've noticed that when I replace the ASP.NET application dll files (which seems to reinit the objects instanciated by .NET), the application automatically disconnects.</p>

<p>I tried several times to call :</p>

<pre><code>GC.Collect();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem remains.
I'm looking for a way to be sure that ANY object created, even COM objects are released.
I tried with <strong>Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject()</strong> but it's not better.</p>

<p>As I put a lock() on that section, there is always at most one user on that part so I can even use hardcore techniques to release the COM objects.</p>

<p>Is there a way to know which object or at least the type of the object that has not been released ?</p>

<pre><code>[FirstName] [LastName]

<p>Right now, we use Reporting Services to allow our administrators to design templates for name tags (some might want a picture of the person, a bar code printed out, name of their organization, etc).  This works ok, but 1) Reporting Services is slow to render and 2) it's not integrated with our application very well -- they have to load up Visual Studio and design the name tag outside of our application.</p>

<p>XAML seems like a good fit for designing the template for name tags.  Virtually any design could be handled with the format and we could use XAML to XPS to print.  </p>

<p>The problem I'm seeing is how to integrate a visual designer that uses a subset of available XAML controls.  We'd really only need simple controls such as Canvas, Grid, TextBlock, Image, etc with drag/drop support.  <strong>I'm not finding much info on whether or not it's possible to host Visual Studio or Sparkle's XAML designer into a separate application.

<p><strong>=== ADDENDUM ===</strong></p>

<p>On the good advice of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/49993/kevin-davis"">Kevin Davis</a>, I just want to quickly elaborate on what Java Servlet Filters are. It is basically an HTTP request interceptor. A chain of filters can be configured between the raw receipt of the request and the final destination of the request. The request parameters (and cookies, headers etc. etc.) are passed to the first filter in the chain and each filter does something with them (or not) and then passes them up the chain (or not. eg. a caching filter may simply return the result, bypassing the rest of the chain and the endpoint).</p>

<p>One of the advantages is the ability to modify or enhance the web app without touching the original endpoint code.</p>

<p>I perused the 3.5 Framework and found two likely candidates: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationexception.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ConfigurationException</code></a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationerrorsexception.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ConfigurationErrorsException</code></a>.</p>

  <p><h3>Remarks</h3> The
  <code>ConfigurationException</code> exception is
  thrown if the application attempts to
  read or write data to the

  unsuccessful. Some possible reasons
  for this can include malformed XML in
  the configuration file, file
  permission issues, and configuration
  properties with values that are not
  valid.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
  
  <p>The <code>ConfigurationException</code> object is
  maintained for backward compatibility.
  The <code>ConfigurationErrorsException</code>
  object replaces it for the
  configuration system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exception actually sounds perfect for what I need, but it's been marked obsolete, so, ixnay on atthay.</p>

<p>This brings us to the thoroughly puzzling <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationerrorsexception.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ConfigurationErrorsException</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException</h2>
  
  <p>The current value is not one of the
  EnableSessionState values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, its documentation is completely useless. (It's that way in both local and online help.) An examination of the class itself shows that it's drastic overkill for what I want. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, I need a standard exception that should be thrown when an application configuration setting is missing or contains an invalid value. You'd think the Framework had such an exception baked into it for applications to use. (It apparently did, but it was marked obsolete, and was replaced by something <em>much</em> larger in scope.)</p>

<p>What solutions, if any, are you guys using for this, and am I going to have to suck it up and roll my own exception for this?</p>

<h2>Edit Addenda</h2>

<p>Some have asked whether or not I could provide a default value, and continue. In certain cases, yes, and in those cases, the exception would not be thrown. However, for certain settings, this won't apply. For instance: database server names and credentials, authentication servers, and paths to installed third party applications. </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that the application I'm primarily working on is a console application running in batch mode, and I want it to throw an exception that is caught by the main method and logged appropriately if the thing isn't appropriately configured. (It's legacy code I've inherited, and currently just <em>assumes</em> everything's peachy.)</p>

I know I could just load all of the values from it and access them manually, but I'd like to be able to access them using the built in functionality of .NET. Is there a way to tell the app to use the config file from something other than a file?</p>

<p>The other option is to open the file, decrypt it, write it out to a temp file, and then use the above code to reference it that way, but if there was an easier way, ideally, I'd like to find it, to have to avoid dealing with additional files.</p>

Why is that? I would think that the attribute instance would basically be a singleton-per-MemberInfo, with 1 instance bound to the Type, PropertyInfo, etc...</p>

<p>Here is my test code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace AttribTest
{
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
class MyAttribAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Value { get; set; }

    public MyAttribAttribute()
        : base()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Created MyAttrib instance"");
    }
}

[MyAttrib(Value = ""SetOnClass"")]
class MyClass
{
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Getting attributes for MyClass."");
        object[] a = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(false);
        ((MyAttribAttribute)a[0]).Value = ""a1"";

        Console.WriteLine(""Getting attributes for MyClass."");
        a = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(false);
        Console.WriteLine(((MyAttribAttribute)a[0]).Value);

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if <em>I</em> were to implement attributes, I would expect the output to be:</p>

<pre><code>Created MyAttrib instance
Getting attributes for MyClass.
Getting attributes for MyClass.
a1
</code></pre>

<p>Where the ""class loader"" (sorry, I have more of a Java background, not 100% sure how .net loads its types) would compile MyClass, and create an instance of MyAttribAttribute, and store them together somewhere. (probably the Perm Gen in the heap if this were Java) The 2 calls to GetCustomAttributes() would then just return the same earlier created instance.</p>

<p>But the actual output is:</p>

<pre><code>Getting attributes for MyClass.
Created MyAttrib instance
Getting attributes for MyClass.
Created MyAttrib instance
SetOnClass
</code></pre>

<p>So... why? It seems like creating a new instance of all these objects for every call is a bit excessive, and not good for performance/memory management.  Is there any way to always get the same instance over and over?</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas why it was designed this way?</p>

<p>The reason I care at all is because I made a custom attribute that internally holds some validation information, so in the Attribute I basically have a ""private bool Validated"" that I set to true. The validation stuff takes a while, so I don't want to run it every time. Now the problem is that since it creates a new instance of the attribute each time I get the attributes, Validated is always ""false"".</p>

The tables involved don't really follow the traditional examples out there (product/orders), so I need some help getting started.  The client is essentially a processing center for cases (similar to a legal case).  Each day, new cases are entered into the DB under the ""cases"" table.  Each column contains some bit of info related to the case.  As the case is being processed, additional one-to-many tables are populated with events related to the case. There are quite a few of these event tables, example tables might be: (case-open, case-dept1, case-dept2, case-dept3, etc.). Each of these tables has a caseid which maps back to the ""cases"" table.  There are also a few lookup tables involved as well.</p>

Part of the requirements is to model information for staff, students and parents. </p>

<p>In the UML class diagram I have modelled this as those three classes being subtypes of a person type.  This is because they will all require information on, among other things, address data.</p>

<p>My question is: how do I model this in the database (mysql)?</p>

<p>Thoughts so far are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a monolithic person table that contains all the information for each type and will have lots of null values depending on what type is being stored.  (I doubt this would go down well with the lecturer unless I argued the case <em>very</em> convincingly).</li>
<li>A person table with three foreign keys which reference the subtypes but two of which will be null - in fact I'm not even sure if that makes sense or is possible?</li>
<li><p>According to this <a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ModelInheritance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipage about django</a> it's possible to implement the primary key on the subtypes as follows:</p>

<pre>""id"" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES ""supertype"" (""id"")</pre></li>
<li>Something else I've not thought of...</li>
</ol>

<p>So for those who have modelled inheritance in a database before; how did you do it?  What method do you recommend and why?</p>

<p>Links to articles/blog posts or previous questions are more than welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>Alright thanks for the answers everyone.  I already had a separate address table so that's not an issue.  </p>

I seems like it should work for me, but it doesn't!  (surprise!)</p>

<p>Anyway, this is what I tried first:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT

Address as ip,
PCName as pc_name,
(Numbers.Phone = 'CPU/' + PCName) as cpu_contact,
(Numbers.Phone = 'PC/' + PCName) as pc_contact,

  OR ('LOGIN/' + PCName = Numbers.Phone)

<p>So what I want is some boolean calculated fields and to join on similar conditions.  I would also like the result to collapse down to single rows.  For example, I think the current setup would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>status ip  cpu_contact pc_contact login_contact
-----------------------------------------------
foo    bar true        false      false
foo    bar false       true       false
foo    bar false       false      true

<p>And obviously I'd rather</p>

<pre><code>status ip  cpu_contact pc_contact login_contact
-----------------------------------------------
foo    bar true        true       true

[Header] = &lt;b&gt;Type A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[Item] = Type A Item 1
</code></pre>

<p>So only the first item of each Type gets a header item and all others are set to an empty string.</p>

<p>Does anyone know any tricks that could help?</p>

<p>We use a program called Clearview to manage service relationships with our customers, including call center and field service work.  In order to better support clients and our field technicians we also developed a web site to provide access to the service records in Clearview and reporting.  Over time our need to customize the behavior and add new features led to more and more things being tied to this website and it's database.</p>

<p>At this point we're dealing with things like a Company being defined partly in the Clearview database and partly in the website database.  For good measure we're also starting to tie the scripting for our phone system into the same website, which will require talking to the phone system's own database as well.</p>

<p>All of this is set up and working... BUT we don't have a <em>good</em> data layer to work with it all.  We moved to Linq to SQL and now have two DBMLs that we can use, along with some custom classes I wrote before I'd ever heard of Linq, along with some of the old style ADO datasets.  So yeah, basically things are a mess.</p>

<p>What I want is a data layer that provides a single front end for our applications, and on the back end manages everything into the correct database.  </p>

<p>I had heard something about Entity Framework allowing classes to be built from multiple sources, but it turns out there can only be one database.  So the question is, how could I proceed with this?</p>

<p>I'm currently thinking of getting the Linq To SQL classes all set for each database, then manually writing Linq compatible front ends that tie those together.  Seems like a lot of work, and given Linq's limitations (such as not being able to refresh) I'm not sure it's a good idea.  </p>

<p>Could I do something with Entity Framework that would turn out better?  Should I look into another tool?  Am I crazy?</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm trying to build a quick and easy ASP.NET page that redirects a user to a new URL using a meta redirect.  Only trouble is that I need to also pass along the GET values of the current request.  I've found a way to do this programatically in the code behind using the HtmlMeta object.  However, I'd like to avoid using the code behind and just put this code directly into the ASPX page.</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" &gt;
&lt;head runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Untitled Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content='10;url=http://contact.test.net/main.aspx?&lt;%=Request.QueryString.ToString()%&gt;' /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><br />
However, this spits out the following meta tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""10;url=http://contact.test.net/main.aspx?&lt;%=Request.QueryString.ToString()%&gt;"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So is there any way to escape the attribute so the ASP.NET code actually executes?</p>

<h3>Solution 1</h3>

<p><hr />
For the time being, I have fixed my problem by removing the quotes from the HTML attribute.  Thus making the meta tag the following:</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=10;url=http://contact.test.net/main.aspx?&lt;%=Request.QueryString.ToString()%&gt; /&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p><br />
Although this fixes the issue, I'd be curious if anyone knows of a more correct way to do it where I could escape the literal quotes of the HTML attribute.
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>Solution 2 (Final Chosen Solution)</h3>

<p><hr />
Per the much appreciated advise of Scott, I decided to go ahead and do this from the code behind.  For anyone who is curious how this was implemented:</p>

<pre>
<code>
    Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
        Dim nRef As String = Request.QueryString(""n"")
        Dim sRef As String = Request.QueryString(""s"")

        Dim contentAttrBuilder As New StringBuilder(""0;http://contact.cableone.net/main.aspx"")
        contentAttrBuilder.Append(""?n="")
        contentAttrBuilder.Append(nRef)
        contentAttrBuilder.Append(""&s="")
        contentAttrBuilder.Append(sRef)

        Dim metaRedirect As New HtmlMeta()
        metaRedirect.HttpEquiv = ""refresh""
        metaRedirect.Content = contentAttrBuilder.ToString()

        Me.Header.Controls.Add(metaRedirect)

    End Sub
</code>
</pre>

I’m a big fan of the big guns like simplicity and flexibility, but I also love the way the Urls end up looking. What can I say, I’m a programmer.</p>
<p>The simple API for retrieving and editing resources is matched by an almost equally simple set of possible error responses, and I can’t help feeling that to keep to a “pure” RESTful approach I may be cutting my nose off to spite by face, or more specifically, the nose of my web service consumers. I could be wrong, but there doesn’t seem to be very many Http error codes that I can use, and no ways to pass back a custom error message.</p>

<p>Possible options I am considering...</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Just use the Http error codes</strong> – This seem like it would be too restrictive in what I am able to express, and won’t allow me to supply a custom message. Please(!) correct me if I am wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Always return Http Success but return custom error objects</strong> – Obviously the most flexible but certainly not the most RESTful.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion of using the <code>StatusDescription</code> property of the <code>OutgoingWebResponseContext</code> object. It seemed at first to be something that I could use.</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that my second option above is not for me. I want to stick to the what Http can give me.</p>
<p>I am having problems getting it to work, however. Regardless of the value I supply for this property, it doesn’t get returned in the response.</p>
<p>My service method looks like this</p>
<pre><code>public MyType GetMyTypes(string criteria)
{
    try
    {
        return GetMyTypes();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        OutgoingWebResponseContext response = WebOperationContext.Current.OutgoingResponse;
        response.StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.Forbidden;
        response.StatusDescription = &quot;A Big fat error occurred&quot;;
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the raw response message. There is no mention of the custom message...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden<br />
Server: ASP.NET Development Server/9.0.0.0<br />

<p>It's not as if I just need to access the correct property on the client. The information is simply not being sent across the link.</p>
<p>What does this <code>StatusDescription</code> property actually do?</p>
<hr />
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>I never did find out how to set the StatusDescription property. I ended up not including any error message at all, and going solely with the Http status codes. I have chosen to expose both Soap and Restful endpoints for my services, and so clients can choose which they prefer to use – the simple Restful messages or the relatively richer Soap messages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is the advantage of steps 1 and 2? With IDEs like Visual Studio this is really annoying to do, since intellisense jumps all over the place trying to guess methods and attributes that are not there.</p>

<p>I usually start on step 3, having all my methods throwing NotImplementedException, and this seems perfectly fine for me, but maybe I am missing something.</p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarification</strong>: this is not a question why I should see a test fail before it passes; that is covered on step 3 onwards, and it makes total sense. My question is why even before that people will call a method on the unit test that doesn't exist in the API (therefore VS will show a red squiggle, or paint the whole method name red etc) and try to compile anyway. For me the fact that VS is telling me that the method does not exist is good enough.</p>

Any help would be appreciated. Here is a simplified layout.</p>

<p>Project <strong>A</strong> - C#, has an internal property I want to access from <strong>B/C</strong>.<br>
Project <strong>B</strong> - Managed C++. References <strong>A</strong>.<br>

<p>The MSDN docs say this works with C++. Is there a bug or something else I need to do?</p>

<p>Is there another way that I can protect a property so that it can only be used by assemblies signed by me? I know I can protect all of my assembly, but can I do it on a granular level like this?</p>

I am on a AIX Unix box, so I am using VAC compilers - no gnu compilers.
<strong>End edit</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>I am pretty rusty in C/C++, so forgive me if this is a simple question.</p>

<p>I would like to take common functions out of a few of my C programs and put them in shared libraries or shared objects.  If I was doing this in perl I would put my subs in a perl module and use that module when needed.</p>

<p>For the sake of an example, let's say I have this function:</p>

<pre><code>int giveInteger()
{
    return 1034;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is not a real world example, but if I wanted to share that function, how would I proceed?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I have 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put my shared function in a file, and have it compile with my main program at compile time.  If I ever make changes to my shared function, I would have to recompile my main program.</li>
<li>Put my shared function in a file, and compile it as a shared library (if I have my terms correct), and have my main program link to that shared library.  Any changes I make to my shared library (after compiling it) would be integrated into my main program at runtime without re-compiling my main program.</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I correct on that thinking?</p>

<p>If so, how can I complish either/both of those methods?  I've searched a lot and I seem to find information how how I could have my own program link to someone else's shared library, but not how to create my own shared functions and compile them in a way I can use them in my own program.</p>

<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p>Brian</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <h2> Conclusion</h2>
Thanks everyone for your help!  I thought I would add to this post what is working for me (for dynamic shared libraries on AIX) so that others can benefit:</p>

<p>I compile my shared functions:</p>

<pre><code>xlc -c sharedFunctions.c -o sharedFunctions.o
</code></pre>

<p>Then make it a shared object:</p>

<pre><code>xlc -qmkshrobj -qexpfile=exportlist sharedFunctions.o
xlc -G -o libsharedFunctions.so sharedFunctions.o  -bE:exportlist
</code></pre>

<p>Then link it another program:</p>

<pre><code>xlc -brtl -o mainProgram mainProgram.c  -L. -lsharedFunctions
</code></pre>

<p>And another comment helped me find this link, which also helped:

I'm currently working on a simple application and I'd like to maybe release it as an open-source project sometime in the future.</p>

<p>As part of my research into J2ME and mobile devices, I looked into applet signing.  It seems that people who want to create applets for free are caught between and rock and an awful shite-place.  Applet signing is extremely expensive and extremely convoluted - and the expense can't be justified when coding for free.</p>

<p>There are a huge number of J2ME compatible devices out there - I think it would be a shame to have to ignore them, and just wait patiently for the next wave (e.g. Android).  </p>

<p>I was wondering if other people have any ideas about ways to approach this problem?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: I found this blog article which summarises the problem for those interested... <a href=""http://javablog.co.uk/2007/08/09/how-midlet-signing-is-killing-j2me/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://javablog.co.uk/2007/08/09/how-midlet-signing-is-killing-j2me/</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>I thought about setting up a non-profit umbrella organisation for open-source J2ME developers who want a VeriSign certificate (as a certificate can sign code an unlimited amount of times).  I would aim to raise the $500 and then enable group members to share the purchased certificate.  Had a quick chat to a VeriSign rep and they thought the idea could work (as long as  the organisation was registered as a legal entity).</strong></p>

<p><strong>However, since handset manufacturers now seem to be moving to support <em>only</em> UTI root certificates (which you can only get through the 'Java verified' programme) - this might not be as useful as I thought it could be... if anyone has any ideas would be great to hear them.</strong></p>

<li><p>Filtering is forward and backwards.  By this, I mean if a user selects a state from lstStates, it will filter lstCounties, lstCities, and lstZipcodes.  If a user selects a zipcode from lstZipcodes, it will filter lstCities, lstCounties, and lstStates.</p></li>

<p>Each listbox is bound to a datatable to get its initial data.  The datatable is retrieved from a sqlserver stored procedure.  Each listbox has its own stored procedure, for example, lstStates has one called GetStates which returns one column (State) and the ListBoxes DataValueField and DataTextField are both set to State.  Similar to lstStates, lstCities is bound to a datatable which gets one column from a GetCities stored proc which is city.</p>

<p>We are at the very early stages of the preliminary design right now. I am seeing a LOT of information from Microsoft on VS 2010.  Is there something wrong with 2005/2008 that we should be concerned about? Or, is this SOP for MS to start pushing future products this early?  Is it worth waiting for 2010 to start any coding?  The functional design probably won't be finished by year end (2009) anyway and we can always do mock ups in VS-2005.</p>

<p>Secondly, FoxPro and VB6 are in the same boat; unsupported but alive for now.  Is moving to .NET smart? VB? C#? Will there come a time when MS decides that moving to VS 20xx requires another complete rewrite of old code (VB6)?  Or might they eliminate VB.net or C#.net for the next 'great' thing (foxpro)?  Or what about the lifespan of the .NET framework? Is it also limited until something else comes along?</p>

<p>We have a pretty big application with years of band-aids, updates and law changes that is already going to be a PIA to convert.  We want a new platform that is going to be stable for decades to come with easy migrations upwards.  Is there <em>any</em> development code that will be around 50 years from now? 100? </p>

<p>The core logic from the application hasn't changed that much since they used pen and paper.  It is difficult to justify a multi-year rewrite now if it needs to be done every 10-20 years.  The FoxPro app started dev in 1991, went live in 1999 and is now due to be rewritten in another language.</p>

<p>Mainframes are easy compared to the fluidity of Win Apps.</p>

<p>Here are some high level specs.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's for a government office.</li>
<li>It contains highly sensitive data.</li>
<li>Web based is not an option.</li>
<li>It will be a MS Windows application only.</li>
<li>Will be moving from FoxPro tables to, probably, SQL Server 2005/8/10 (whatever is current)</li>
</ul>

<p>I know those with working crystal balls won't reply, but what is the <em>feel</em> of the community for the likelihood of a programming language settling down and being available/stable long term?</p>

<p>Thanks for your opinions on this, I appreciate them.</p>

This might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element.""</p>

30497.0,418162,17,192,2009-01-06,418066,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/418066/best-way-to-test-for-a-variables-existence-in-php-isset-is-clearly-broken,Best way to test for a variable&#39;s existence in PHP; isset() is clearly broken,"<p>From the <a href=""http://php.net/isset"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>isset()</code> docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>isset() will return FALSE if testing a variable that has been set to NULL.
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, <code>isset()</code> doesn't check for whether the variable is set at all, but whether it's set to anything but <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>Given that, what's the best way to actually check for the existence of a variable?  I tried something like:</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($v) || @is_null($v))
</code></pre>

<p>(the <code>@</code> is necessary to avoid the warning when <code>$v</code> is not set) but <code>is_null()</code> has a similar problem to <code>isset()</code>: it returns <code>TRUE</code> on unset variables!  It also appears that:</p>

<pre><code>@($v === NULL)
</code></pre>

<p>works exactly like <code>@is_null($v)</code>, so that's out, too.</p>

<p>How are we supposed to reliably check for the existence of a variable in PHP?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: there is clearly a difference in PHP between variables that are not set, and variables that are set to <code>NULL</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$a = array('b' =&gt; NULL);
var_dump($a);
</code></pre>

<p>PHP shows that <code>$a['b']</code> exists, and has a <code>NULL</code> value.  If you add:</p>

<pre><code>var_dump(isset($a['b']));
var_dump(isset($a['c']));
</code></pre>

<p>you can see the ambiguity I'm talking about with the <code>isset()</code> function.  Here's the output of all three of these <code>var_dump()s</code>:</p>

<pre><code>array(1) {
  [""b""]=&gt;
  NULL
}
bool(false)
bool(false)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Further edit: two things.</p>

<p>One, a use case.  An array being turned into the data of an SQL <code>UPDATE</code> statement, where the array's keys are the table's columns, and the array's values are the values to be applied to each column.  Any of the table's columns can hold a <code>NULL</code> value, signified by passing a <code>NULL</code> value in the array.  You <em>need</em> a way to differentiate between an array key not existing, and an array's value being set to <code>NULL</code>; that's the difference between not updating the column's value and updating the column's value to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>Second, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/418066/best-way-to-test-for-a-variables-existence-in-php-isset-is-clearly-broken#418162"">Zoredache's answer</a>, <code>array_key_exists()</code> works correctly, for my above use case and for any global variables:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$a = NULL;
var_dump(array_key_exists('a', $GLOBALS));
var_dump(array_key_exists('b', $GLOBALS));
</code></pre>

<p>outputs:</p>

<pre><code>bool(true)
bool(false)
</code></pre>

<p>Since that properly handles just about everywhere I can see there being any ambiguity between variables that don't exist and variables that are set to <code>NULL</code>, <strong>I'm calling <code>array_key_exists()</code> the official easiest way in PHP to truly check for the existence of a variable</strong>.</p>

<p>(Only other case I can think of is for class properties, for which there's <code>property_exists()</code>, which, according to <a href=""http://php.net/property_exists"" rel=""noreferrer"">its docs</a>, works similarly to <code>array_key_exists()</code> in that it properly distinguishes between not being set and being set to <code>NULL</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>for x in string.printable: print x,
print
for x in string.printable: print x

<p>The first line successfully prints all the characters separated by a space. The two odd characters turn out as the Male and Female symbols.</p>

<p>The second line successfully prints all the characters EXCEPT THE LAST separated by a line feed. The Male symbol prints; the female symbol is replaced with a missing character (a box).</p>

<p>It's best practice not to initialize the following types in the .NET framework because the CLR initializes them for you:</p>

<p>int, 
bool, etc.</p>

<p>and same for setting an object to null (I believe).</p>

<p>For example you do not need to do this and in fact it's a performance hit (drops in the bucket or not):</p>

But how can you tell what those primitive types are set to.  I tried opening up Reflector to take a look at int32 and bool but could not figure out how they are initialized by default.</p>

<p>This may seem like a stupid thing to do. But I am in the process of implementing a compression algorithm. I just want to have the bit accessing part down right.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>PS: This is in on the Visual Studio 2008 compiler. So it would be nice if the suggestions applied to that compiler.</p>

<p>PPS: I just realized, that I don't need to increment two counts. One would be enough. Then compute the difference to the total bits at the end.
But that would be specific to just counting. What I really want done fast is the bit extraction.</p>

<p>EDIT:
The lookup table idea that was brought forward is nice.
I realize though that I posed the question wrong in the title.
Because in the end what I want to do is not count the bits, but access each bit as fast as possible.</p>

<p>ANOTHER EDIT:
Is it possible to advance a pointer by just one bit in the data?</p>

<p>ANOTHER EDIT:
Thank you for all your answers so far.</p>

<p>What I want to implement in the next steps is a nonsophisticated binary arithmetic coder that does not analyze the context. So I am only interested in single bits for now. Eventually it will become a Context-adaptive BAC but I will leave that for later.</p>

<p>Processing 4 bytes instead of 1 byte could be an option. But a loop over 32 bits is costly as well, isn't it?</p>

The office has high staff turnover, so training suffers, and so one of the self imposed requirements for this project is comprehensive, friendly documentation. However, to supplement this, and to save newbies having to open up a 100 page document when they want to try something new, I want a status bar on every userform (there are five) that provides contextual help. I find tooltips annoying.</p>

<p>I don't have a lot of experience, so I was wanting to</p>

<p>Essentially, I have a file containing every status string. (This is currently a text file, but I was wondering if I should use a spreadsheet or csv for ease of editing by other staff in future.) Every control has a MouseMove event which refers to a function: getStatus(cID) that opens the file, grabs the line and displays it in the status label. It also grabs a few parameters from the same line in the file, such as whether the label is clickable (to link to a page in the help file), and what colour the label should be.</p>

<p>So a few questions really:</p>

<p>Will the application be slow if a userform is constantly referring to a file? It feels fine to me, but I've been in it far too long, and I'm the only user accessing that file. There will be 80 constantly accessing it.</p>

<p>Is MouseMove over a control the best way? Should I instead use co-ordinates?</p>

<p>Most importantly (in terms of me having to do as little work as possible) is there some way to do this so that I do not have to have a MouseMove event on every single control? I have a good few hundred or so controls, each with their own identifier (well, not yet, but they will if this is the only way to do it). Maybe when the form loads I could load ALL the possible status lines so they're ready for whenever the control is moused over. But then, maybe the loading time is negligible?</p>

<p>Appreciate any ideas or thoughts - especially if VBA already has a whole range of functions to do this already and I'm just trying to reinvent the wheel. I can't use the application status bar, because the user rarely sees the application itself.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>It is for both data entry, clicking around and a bit of document generation. </p>

<p>It is a controlled environment so macro security issues aren't a big concern for me - and if something goes wrong it's someone else's fault or problem :)</p>

Here's the issue:</p>

<p>A blog had something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var anonymousMagic = new {test.UserName};

lblShowText.Text = lblShowText
                     .Text
                     .Format(""{UserName}"", test);

<p>As sort of a wish list and a couple ways to go at it.  Being bored and adventurous I took to creating an string extension method that could handle this:</p>

<pre><code>var anonymousMagic = new {test.UserName, test.UserID};

lblShowText.Text = ""{UserName} is user number {UserID}""
                     .FormatAdvanced(anonymousMagic);
</code></pre>

<p>With the idea that I would get the property info from the anonymous type and match that to the bracketted strings.  Now with property info comes reflection, so I would want to save the property info the first time the type came through so that I wouldn't have to get it again.  So I did something like this:</p>

        if (infoList == null)
        {
            infoList = new Dictionary&lt;String, Dictionary&lt;String, PropertyInfo&gt;&gt;();
        }
        //

        {
            info = infoList[typeName];

        else
        {
            info = test.GetProperties()
                       .ToDictionary(item =&gt; item.Name);

<p>Now in testing, it seems to keep the name it created for the anonymous type so that the second time through it doesn't get the property info off the type but off the dictionary. </p>

<p>If multiple people are hitting this method at the same time, is it pretty much going to work in a Session like fassion;  IE the names of the types will be specific to each instance of the program?  Or would it be even worse than that?  At what point does that name get chucked and overwritten?</p>

I'm using the standard Catalyst framework authentication modules, so the user data is stored in the session -- i.e., when your session expires, you get logged out.</p>

<p>Many of the uses of this application will require >15 minutes to complete, so users will frequently submit a form only to find their session state is gone and they're required to log back in.</p>

<p>If this happens I want to preserve the original form submission, and if they log in successfully, continue on and carry out the form submission just as if the session had not expired.</p>

<p>I've got the authentication stuff being handled by an auto() method in the controller -- if you request an action that requires authentication and you're not currently logged in, you get redirected to the login() method, which displays the login form and then processes it once it's submitted. It seems like it should be possible to store the request and any form parameters when the auto method redirects to the login(), and then pull them back out if the login() succeeds -- but I'm not entirely sure of the best way to grab or store this information in a generic/standard/reusable way. (I'm figuring on storing it in the session and then deleting it once it's pulled back out; if that seems like a bad idea, that's something else to address.)</p>

I animate the position on each of those CALayers, but they have the exact same duration. Once all of those CALayers are finished animating, a new ""turn"" is initiated and they animate changing positions again.</p>

<p>The whole idea is that with a linear interpolation between positions, and at a constant speed, a turn based transition between state to state looks like a real time animation. This, however, is hard to achieve with many different CALayers. </p>

<p>CAAnimationGroup is used to group together animations on a single CALayer. But I was wondering, is there a simple solution to group animations, which are supposed to have the same durations, on several CALayers together?</p>

<p><em>Edited to include a reply to Kevin Ballard's question</em></p>

<p>My problem lies in this. I'm creating animations for each of my CALayers, then putting 
those in an NSArray. Once I get the callback that the individual animation has ended, I remove it form the NSArray. Once it's empty, I again create animations for them all.</p>

<p>With more than a few layers, there's a noticeable delay between where all of the animations finished and the new ones start.</p>

<p>I imagine that if I could group all of these animations into a single one, a lot more layers could be animated without a delay between animations. Thereby not ruining the illusions of a contiguous animation.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, I use  the transform property to move the picker in and out (down) my main view; the startEditing and stopEditing methods are triggered by selection in the teble view. Yet, for the debugging purposes, I eliminated these transitions , and left the picker on top of the table, but nothing changed. I also commented the didSelect method, but this also didn't change anything.
By the way, the same picker-view construction code vorkw allright in another view of the same app.
Any suggestion?

Anyway, I have what I think should be an easy problem to solve:</p>

<p>I have a pop-up menu consisting of a list of radio buttons, and when I click one of them I want some action to occur.  The code goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Gtk::RadioMenuItem::Group group;
    for ( size_t i = 1; i &lt; LH_MAX; ++i )
    {
        Gtk::RadioMenuItem* pItem = new Gtk::RadioMenuItem( group, names[i], names[i] );
        pItem-&gt;set_name( names[i] );
        pItem-&gt;signal_activate().connect( sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;MyClass::on_item_activated) );
        pItem-&gt;show();
        m_Menu.append( *Gtk::manage(pItem) );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem I see is that <code>MyClass::on_item_activated</code> gets called twice when a previously-unselected radio button is chosen from the menu.  It's called only once when the already-selected radio button is clicked.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the first firing is to say ""something is no longer activate,"" and the second is for the new radio button activation.  Whether I'm right or wrong, the question is the same: how best can I have my handler only take action once per click?  Either I need the handler to get called only once, or I need something to check from inside it to know if the callback is a ""duplicate"" or not.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *

         SELECT UserId 
         FROM CompanyRolesToUsers

</code></pre>

<p>There is a FK relationship between <code>CompanyRolesToUsers</code> and <code>Users</code>, but it's a many to many relationship and <code>CompanyRolesToUsers</code> is the junction table.</p>

<p>We already have most of our site built, and we already have most of the filtering working by building Expressions using a PredicateExtensions class.</p>

<p>The code for the straightforward filters looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code> if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(TextBoxLastName.Text))
 {
     predicateAnd = predicateAnd.And(c =&gt; c.LastName.Contains(
                                     TextBoxLastName.Text.Trim()));
 }

e.Result = context.Users.Where(predicateAnd);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to add a predicate for a subselect in another table. (<code>CompanyRolesToUsers</code>)</p>

<p>What I'd like to be able to add is something that does this:</p>

<pre><code>int[] selectedRoles = GetSelectedRoles();
if( selectedRoles.Length &gt; 0 )
{
    //somehow only select the userid from here ???:
    var subquery = from u in CompanyRolesToUsers
                   where u.RoleID in selectedRoles
                   select u.UserId;

    //somehow transform this into an Expression ???:
    var subExpression = Expression.Invoke(subquery);

    //and add it on to the existing expressions ???:
    predicateAnd = predicateAnd.And(subExpression);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to do this? It's frustrating because I can write the stored procedure easily, but I'm new to this LINQ thing and I have a deadline. I haven't been able to find an example that matches up, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.</p>

I've built Flash components and created an MVC framework in Flex, etc.&lt;/self-definition&gt;</p>

<p>If you hand me a Flex app that I've never seen and say, ""make these changes,"" I know where to start understanding the application: from the Application tag downwards. It's probably got some interaction with a server somewhere, with some callbacks, etc. Or some interaction with a framework.</p>

<p>If you hand me a Java app I can do the same: go from the front-end to the back end, or maybe go backwards through the method calls.</p>

<p>But if you hand me a Flash app I'm totally lost for the first hour while I try to guess why it works the way it does... and if it doesn't compile, I think I would be lost forever. This has to do with the MCs embedded in MCs (some of them hidden! great!), and not so much to do with the code. Then the code is spread out in all different frames, scenes, etc., so as to when what fires only the original developer knows.</p>

<p>When I do pure Flash I do everything in Components and use a very flat structure, but that´s a different story. My question is for the Flash presentations I get:</p>

<p><strong>How do you start understanding an existing Flash presentation when you get it? What do you look for first, etc.? Do you have any tips on making sense of a Flash presentation you're seeing for the first time?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>According to the responses, here are the pros and cons of using <code>RNGCryptoServiceProvider</code> so far:</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>RNGCryptoServiceProvider</code> is a stronger cryptographically random number, meaning it would be better for determining encryption keys and the likes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>Random</code> is faster because it is a simpler calculation; when used in simulations or long calculations where cryptographic randomness isn't important, this should be used. Note: see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/54847919/9536"">Kevin's answer</a> for details about simulations - <code>Random</code> is not necessarily random enough, and you may want to use a different non-cryptographic PRNG.</li>

<hr />
<p>I cannot confirm that Syntax on the SQLite site for TABLE CREATE.
I have not built a demo to test it, but it doesn't seem to be supported.</p>
<p>If it was, I have three columns so it would actually look like:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table1( 
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob1 BLOB ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob2 BLOB ON CONFLICT REPLACE,

So I assume Blob1 and Blob2 would not be replaced (as desired)</p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATEs in SQLite when binding data are a complete transaction, meaning
Each sent row to be updated requires:  Prepare/Bind/Step/Finalize statements
unlike the INSERT which allows the use of the reset function</p>
<p>The life of a statement object goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the object using sqlite3_prepare_v2()</li>
<li>Bind values to host parameters using sqlite3_bind_ interfaces.</li>
<li>Run the SQL by calling sqlite3_step()</li>
<li>Reset the statement using sqlite3_reset() then go back to step 2 and repeat.</li>
<li>Destroy the statement object using sqlite3_finalize().</li>
</ol>
<p>UPDATE I am guessing is slow compared to INSERT, but how does it compare to SELECT using the Primary key?</p>
<p>Perhaps I should use the select to read the 4th column (Blob3) and then use REPLACE to write a new record blending the original 4th Column with the new data for the first 3 columns?</p>

<p>In a language like Perl, I could <code>unshift()</code> the apple back onto the tree, and then let the loop expression re-pick the apple:</p>

<pre><code>while ($apple = shift(@tree)) {
  $wt = weight($apple);
  if ($wt + weight(@basket) &gt; 10) {

    @basket = ();
    unshift(@tree, $apple);
  } else {
    push(@basket, $element);

<p>Or else I can also use <code>redo</code>, which resumes processing at the top of block, without evaluating the loop expression.  So the same apple can be re-processed, after the basket has been emptied.</p>

<pre><code>Found 233 matches in 150 matching files. Scanned 3,297 total files in 5.72s
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, writing the code in a 'pure functional' style like above, each item is lazily loaded.<br>
You only know how many files match in total until the final foreach loop completes, and because only one item is ever <code>yield</code>ed at a time, the code doesn't have any place to keep track of how many things it's found previously. If you invoke LINQ's <code>matchingLines.Count()</code> method, it will re-enumerate the collection!</p>

<p>I can think of many ways to solve this problem, but all of them seem to be somewhat ugly. It strikes me as something that people are bound to have done before, and I'm sure there'll be a nice design pattern which shows a best practice way of doing this.</p>

I have a matrix m of two columns (x and y values).  I know that I can extract the column by doing m(:,1) or m(:,2).  I want to split it into smaller matricies of [potentially] equal size and and plot the mean of these matricies.  In other words, I want to put the values into bins based on the x values, then find means of the bins.  I feel like the hist function should help me, but it doesn't seem to.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a built-in function to do something like this?</p>

<p><em>edit</em></p>

<p>I had intended to mention that I looked at hist and couldn't get it to do what I wanted, but it must have slipped my mind.</p>

<p>Example:  Let's say I have the following (I'm trying this in octave, but afaik it works in matlab):</p>

<pre><code>x=1:20;
y=[1:10,10:1];
m=[x, y];

<p>If I want 10 bins, I would like m to be split into:</p>

<pre><code>m1=[1:2, 1:2]

m5=[9:10, 9:10]
m6=[10:11, 10:-1:9]

For this problem in particular, I'm using git, but I'm curious about how to deal with this for all version control systems.</p>

<p>I'm developing a web application on a development server. I have defined the absolute path name to the web application (not the document root) in two places. On the production server, this path is different. I'm confused about how to deal with this.</p>

<p>I could either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reconfigure the development server to share the same path as the production</li>
<li>Edit the two occurrences each time production is updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't like #1 because I'd rather keep the application flexible for any future changes. I don't like #2 because if I start developing on a second development server with a third path, I would have to change this for every commit and update.</p>

<p>What is the best way to handle this? I thought of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using custom keywords and variable expansion (such as setting the property $PATH$ in the version control properties and having it expanded in all the files). Git doesn't support this because it would be a huge performance hit.</p></li>
<li><p>Using post-update and pre-commit hooks. Possibly the likely solution for git, but every time I looked at the status, it would report the two files as being changed. Not really clean.</p></li>
<li><p>Pulling the path from a config file outside of version control. Then I would have to have the config file in the same location on all servers. Might as well just have the same path to begin with.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there an easy way to deal with this? Am I over thinking it?</p>

<p>We want to record a key sequence from the user in a friendly way that will be repeated at some later date.  The user presses a record button, a dialog is displayed with a stop button and the recorded keys.</p>

<p>One advantage of using the journaling hook was that you only got keystrokes which did something.  Holding down shift didn't report 100 shift keys, but did report usage when you hit a letter.
Another advantage was that you could set the focus to an area outside of the application, say another applications window, and record the action as the user interacted.</p>

<p>Asides from making the keyboard capture part of the existing app a separate executable which runs as administrator with uiAccess, I'm seeking other ideas on how to record keystrokes that work on windows for 2K, 2K3, 2K8, XP, Vista.</p>

<p>Edit: I know there is a security concern with just recording anything, obviously if you could do such a thing without the users notice you have your typical keystroke logger for hacking purposes. Soooooo.....</p>

<p>Is there a way to make journaling work, for this user, and their apps, running at the same level (or lower) and capture keystrokes?  having it popup the vista security are you sure dialog would be allright, but the process cannot be marked with uiAccess (otherwise it won't interact properly with the rest of the system) and it will in 98% of cases be run by users without rights to elevate to administrator.</p>

<pre><code>string Data = """";
Data +=""\n\nHTTP/1.1 "" + Status_code;
Data += ""\nContent-Type: "" + Content_Type;
Data += ""\nServer: PT06"";
Data += ""\nContent-Length: "" + Content_Lengt;
Data += ""\nDate: "" + Date;
Data += ""\n"" + HTML;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'd like to do the exact same thing in C and I'm trying to do this the following way</p>

<pre><code>time_t rawtime;

time ( &amp;rawtime );

char *message = ""\n\nHTTP/1.1 "";
message = strcat(message, Status_code);
message = strcat(message, ""\nContent-Type: "");
message = strcat(message, Content_Type);
message = strcat(message, ""\nServer: PT06"");
message = strcat(message, ""\nContent-Length: "");
message = strcat(message, Content_Lengt);
message = strcat(message,  ""\nDate: "");
message = strcat(message, ctime(&amp;rawtime));
message = strcat(message, ""\n"");
message = strcat(message, HTML);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this gives me a Segment fault, I know why, I access and read on memory that i shouldn't. But the question is, how do i solve it? Could I use string.h and just do it the same way that I did in C#?</p>

Would this at all be possible you think? A bit like <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/smartpart"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jan Tielens SmartPart</a>, only not for ASP.Net User Controls, but for other Web parts... ;)</p>

<p>Edit: We've been able to do this now. The solution was actually pretty simple. Check out the code:</p>

<pre><code>public class WebPartWrapper : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart {
    protected override void CreateChildControls() {    
        Panel pnl = new Panel();
        this.Controls.Add(pnl);

        pnl.Controls.Add(dynamicPart);
    }
}

<p>Easy as that... We also use reflection to store the webparts as Xml etc., but that's beside the point.</p>

I would like to pan the image within the view using an animation (so that the pan is nice and smooth).</p>

<p>It seems to me that I should be able to just adjust the <code>bounds.origin</code> of the <code>UIImageView</code>, and the image should move (because the image should paint inside the view with that as <strong>its</strong> origin, right?) but that doesn't seem to work. The <code>bounds.origin</code> changes, but the image draws in the same location.</p>

<p>What almost works is to change the <code>contentsRect</code> of the view's layer. But this begins as a unit square, even though the viewable area of the image is not the whole image. So I'm not sure how I would detect that the far edge of the image is being pulled into the viewable area (which I need to avoid, since it displays by stretching the edge out to infinity, which looks, well, sub-par).</p>

<p>My view currently has its <code>contentsGravity</code> set to <code>kCAGravityTopLeft</code> via Interface Builder, if that makes a difference (Is it causing the image to move?). No other options seemed to be any better, though.</p>

<p>UPDATE: to be clear, I want to move the image <strong>inside</strong> the view, while keeping the view in the same spot.</p>

<p>It seems to me that explicitly specifying serialVersionUID for new classes is bad. Consider the two cases of not changing it when layout has it should have been changed and changing it when it should not have. </p>

<p>Not changing when it should have been changed occurs almost only when it is explicit. In this case, it results in some very subtle, hard-to-find bugs. Especially during development, when class layout changes often. But if it has not been explicitly specified, it will change and the deserialization will break loudly, mostly likely solved by purging the repository.</p>

<p>Changing it when should not have would occur almost only when it is implicit. This is the rare case where class layout has changed but we still want to deserialize from the old serialized blobs. This will likely be caught during QA (<em>Strange errors after upgrade from 5.2 to 5.2.1, see attached stack trace</em>) and can be trivially fixed by setting a explicit value. </p>

for Windows.  </li>
<li>And is it safe to

<p>So obviously i must be drunk to forgot about those other extension. :)
Thus i've updated the current regex to allow from 1-4chars.</p>

<p>In this case, how should i change my regex line to properly match it? 
Or is it an even better idea to look for all those commonly used extension from google and put them into an array to be passed to the function instead? My users are usually either students or teachers.</p>

<p>Back in 2003/4 when I jumped into the development line, I felt servers only belonged to the data centre, and did not believe in the pricing of servers for home use; consumer computing power was already pretty solid (back then), and similarly-speced PCs could be had for a fraction of the cost. Having assembled my own PCs since i was a school kid, I viewed the activity of obtaining second-hand components to build a new PC as an easy task. It was straightforward to prepare a PC that would act as a dedicated Windows 2003 server for my development tests. But for over three years now, I have been <a href=""http://icelava.net/mycomputers.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">operating on real servers</a>, albeit low-end models. I ended up in this state due to a number of factors.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>. Server hardware built to work properly together. Tested to run server operating systems. Hardware that I assemble together may or may not work due to all those funny instances of unexpected incompatibilities. And unfortunately I ran into those situations more often than I should, like having to figure out why the PC won't boot up because I have the RAM modules plugged in a particular order, or by simple use of a particular DVD drive. I have not seen a single BSOD for my servers.</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong>. I leave my servers running 24x7 and for years have (thankfully) not experienced any failure in server hardware. In contrast my PCs are just cursed with rapid failure rates. Even my vendor-purchased laptops eventually sport funny problems one way or another (especially with power supply units).</li>
<li><strong>Warranty</strong>. I may have warranty for individual PC parts, but the warranty for the computer as a whole is against <em>myself</em>. If something were to fail, I myself was the person to call up for help. And call myself I did several times. With the server however, I call techsupport and get them to replace parts.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong>. Virtualization is truly a wonderful thing. Makes setting up single-purpose machines so much easier to manage. I directly loaded my first server to the max with 4GB RAM and happily ran a variety of virtual machines, simulating the multi-server/workstation environments I needed. Now my new server has capacity for 24GB RAM to afford the bigger scenarios I am looking to experiment with (e.g. AD domains, BizTalk server group, TFS group, etc).</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, with cranky DIYs I spent more time troubleshooting hardware problems than working on actual development issues. When I threw in the money to purchase real servers there was an instant drop in hardware problems in my life. I would probably have bought a vendor-built workstation too if only I could find a configuration that suited my development needs.</p>

<p>Now, some of my tech friends who are passionate with their work also operate their own servers at home. The thing is, most other folks/colleagues get rather surprised that I would actually spend cash for this category of machines. Some would classify me as insane. Have I truly gone overboard?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE - Clarification on server usage</strong></p>

<p>The base server (Windows Server 2008) serves basic IIS 7/ASP.NET, SQL Server 2008, and Subversion services. But the largest role it plays is <strong>hosting a variety of virtual machines in Hyper-V</strong>. I am not a developer who is merely told to whack out application code against a single database and check it into some version control repository then go home without worrying how the application and implementation works out in a production environment. As a solutions integrator, I have to get an understanding of the client/customer environment and think of the big-picture solution that includes <em>infrastructure and deployment concerns</em>. Software application development, while being my primary role, is but a part of the solution.</p>

<p>I frequently find myself having to experiment and discover if certain suggestions or approaches would work for a given environment, and have had to prepare virtual servers like a forest of domains (controllers), web servers, database servers, BizTalk server groups, Team Foundation server, etc to conduct my analysis and solidify my recommendations. These virtual machines work as my personal POCs. The scenarios I face continue to grow larger, and I definitely do not see how I can get to learn how to handle these situations without a base platform that allows me to virtualise and simulate them.</p>

In case there are any experts (even those with limited experience will do), can I please have some guidelines as to how to do it, how to test it and how to verify it?</p>

<p>Bear in mind that I've never set foot anywhere near Japan, it is simply that the product I'm developing is used there, among other places.</p>

<p>What (I think) I know so far is following:<br>
- Japanese emails should be encoded in ISO-2022-JP, Japanese JIS codepage 50220 or possibly SHIFT_JIS codepage 932<br>
- Email transfer encoding should be set to Base64 for plain text and 7Bit for Html<br>
- Email subject should be encoded separately to start with ""=?ISO-2022-JP?B?"" (don't know what this is supposed to mean). I've tried encoding the subject with  </p>

<pre><code>""=?ISO-2022-JP?B?"" + Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(subject))
</code></pre>

<p>which basically gives the encoded string as expected but it doesn't get presented as any japanese text in an email program<br>
- I've tested in Outlook 2003, Outlook Express and GMail  </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, so to post a short update, thanks to the two helpful answers, I've managed to get the right format and encoding. Now, Outlook gives something that resembles the correct subject:<br>
<code>=?iso-2022-jp?B?6  Japanese test に各々の視点で語ってもらった。  6相当の防水?=</code></p>

<p>However, the exact same email in Outlook Express gives subject like this:<br>
<code>=?iso-2022-jp?B?6  Japanese test 縺ｫ蜷・・・隕也せ縺ｧ隱槭▲縺ｦ繧ゅｉ縺｣縺溘・ 6逶ｸ蠖薙・髦ｲ豌ｴ?=</code></p>

<p>Furthermore, when viewed in the Inbox view in Outlook Express, the email subject is even more weird, like this:<br>
<code>=?iso-2022-jp?B?6  Japanese test ??????????????? 6???????=</code></p>

<p>Gmail seems to be working in the similar fashion to Outlook, which looks correct.</p>

<p>I just can't get my head around this one.</p>

For example, if the pre-build event contains this (either directly or within a batch file):</p>

<pre><code>set MY_LIB_VERSION=1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>and AdditionalIncludeDirectories has this:</p>

<pre><code>c:\path\to\library\my_lib_v$(MY_LIB_VERSION)\include

<p>I deduce that the environment variable set in the pre-build event therefore isn't being propagated to the compilation step, but I may be missing something.</p>

<p><strong>How can I set the environment variable in the pre-build event and use it in the compilation step?</strong></p>

<p>(Alternatively, any other sensible ways of defining a library version once and using it several times for AdditionalIncludeDirectories and AdditionalLibraryDirectories would do just as well.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I ended up solving our problem in a different way.  We are using Subversion, and set up the <code>svn:externals</code> property on a subdirectory of the project source called <code>dependencies</code>, such that a checkout of the project would additionally check out <code>&lt;svn_path&gt;\libraries\my_lib_v1.0.0</code> and call it <code>dependencies\my_lib</code> in the working copy.  Then the project settings could refer to <code>dependencies\my_lib\include</code> and suchlike.  Upgrading to version 1.0.1 of <code>my_lib</code> is then simply a matter of editing the <code>svn:externals</code> property -- the code and project settings did not need to change.</p>

<p>I use subversive within Eclipse Ganymede. When I just drag the file from one package to the other, all references get updated and the file is moved around on the filesystem.

The first (#billboard) is some centered text and the second (#picright) holds an image. They are arranged next to each other, text on left, image on right.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response
     SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the
     status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location
     header (see Section 10.4).</p>

<p>The standard response actually seems to be to send a Redirect to the newly created resource.</p>

<p>I'm building my site with ASP.NET MVC, and tried to follow the spec, so created a <code>ResourceCreatedResult</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>public class ResourceCreatedResult : ActionResult
{
    public string Location { get; set; }
    public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
    {
        context.HttpContext.Response.Clear();
        context.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 201;
        context.HttpContext.Response.ClearHeaders();
        context.HttpContext.Response.AddHeader(""Location"", Location);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And my action looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult CreateNew(string entityStuff)
{
    Entity newEntity = new Entity(entityStuff);
    IEntityRepository entityRepository = ObjectFactory.GetInstance&lt;IEntityRepository&gt;();
    entityRepository.Add(newEntity);

    ActionResult result = new ResourceCreatedResult()
        { Location = Url.Action(""Show"", new { id = newEntity.Id }) };
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, IE, Firefox and Chrome all fail to redirect to the new resource.  Have I messed up generating the correct response, or do web browsers not expect this type of response, instead relying on servers to send a Redirect response?</p>

However, when my OnLoad event is fired on postback, all my template columns no longer have the user controls.

        }

        dt.Rows.Add(defRow);
    }

\\?\L:\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.3\OLAP\Data\MSMDCacheRowset_xxx.tmp.
Logical file: . .
</code></pre>

<p>My guess is that this is related to the amount of growing data (currently 15 million rows in the specific table).</p>

<ul>
<li>It has worked before (no changes has been made)</li>
<li>The processing reads 11 million rows before displaying the error</li>
<li>Physical memory on the server runs out at the time the error is displayed</li>
<li>Googling the error message results in a few hits indicating column size as a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Could anyone point me in the right direction? I guess that one way out could be to try using smaller columns (varchar(x) instead of varchar(y)) but it feels like going around the problem instead of solving the issue.</p>

<p>I want to provide a search box on my web page that when typing, each word is searched for in the database and results returned. I was looking for a solution that doesn't involve setting up sql full text search as I want to be able to test this using Linq to SQL.</p>

<p>From my old code I have a function which creates a query filter given the input text and returns all the results based on that.</p>

<pre><code>Private Function SetupQuery(ByVal searchText As String) As String
    Dim searchFields As New List(Of String)

    searchFields.Add(""Name"")
    searchFields.Add(""Postcode"")
    searchFields.Add(""Cuisine"")

    Dim compareString As String
    For Each col As String In searchFields
        For j = 0 To a.GetUpperBound(0)
            compareString = a(j).ToUpper()
            compareString = compareString.Trim()

        Next
    Next

    Return filter
End Function

<p>This has the search fields hard coded and then loops through each one and each word in the search text to construct an OR LIKE filter.</p>

<p>I'm sure I could then use this in my LINQ code but it doesn't seem like an elegant solution especially since the columns are hard coded and not used how LINQ uses them.</p>

<p>Could anyone recomend a better way to do this or some tips in what direction to go with this? </p>

<p>One person there argued that the reason for a 'debug' version is that it's easier to debug: but, I counter-argued that you may eventually want to support and debug whatever it is you released, and so you need to build a release which you can if necessary debug ... this may mean enabling debug symbols, and disabling some optimizations, even in the 'release' build.</p>

<p>Someone else said that ""this is such a bad idea""; it's a policy I evolved some years ago, having been burned by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some developers' testing their debug but not release versions</li>
<li>Some developers' writing bugs which show up only in the release version</li>
<li>The company's releasing the release version after inadequate testing (is it <strong>ever</strong> entirely adequate?)</li>
<li>Being called on to debug the release version</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then I've seen more than one other development shop follow this practice (i.e. not have separate debug and release builds).</p>

I've created a BindingSource object bound to a List. Actually it's bound to an anonymous type list created though Linq in the following manner (variable names changed for clarity of what I'm doing):</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;myType&gt; myList = new List&lt;myType&gt;(someCapacity);
.
...populate the list with query from database...
.

var query = from i in myList
            select new

                i.FieldA,
                i.FieldB,
                i.FieldC
            };

myBindingSource.DataSource = query;
myDataGrid.DataSource = myBindingSource;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create a DataGridTableStyle object and add it to the datagrid. However, it never applies my table style properties I set up because I can't seem set the proper myDataGridTableStyle.MappingName property.</p>

<p>I've searched Google for about 1/2 an hour and keep seeing links to the same question throughout a bunch of different forums (literally the same text, like someone just copied and pasted the question... I hate that...). Anyway, none of the suggestions work, just like the guy says on all the other sites.</p>

<p>So does anybody here know what I need to set the MappingName property to in order to have my TableStyle actually work properly? Where can I grab the name from? (It can't be blank... that only works with a BindingSource that is bound to a DataTable or SqlCeResultSet etc.). </p>

<p>I'm thinking it could be an issue with me using Linq to create an anonymous, more specialized version of the objects with only the fields I need. Should I just try to bind the BindingSource directly to the List object? Or maybe even bind the DataGrid directly to the List object and skip the binding source altogether.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>PS - C#, Compact Framework v3.5</p>

<p>I already tried to specify an IFrame as the target of my HTML form, hoping that the <code>onload</code> event would be triggered. It is not, however -- probably because the PDF is sent with a ""<code>Content-disposition: attachment</code>"" header and it is not actually loaded into the IFrame.</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of right now involves generating the PDF to a temporary file on the server, which I would like to avoid.</p>

<p>*)Let me clarify this: I wouldn't need to know if the download was finished or even if it was really started. I'd like to detect the point at which the browser will ask the user whether to open or to save the file. I guess this happens when the browser receives the HTTP header.</p>

<p>The following structure, using an int field is perfectly legal:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{ 
    public MyStruct ( int size ) 
    { 
        this.Size = size; // &lt;-- Legal assignment.
    } 

    public int Size; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the following structure, using an automatic property does not compile:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{ 
    public MyStruct ( int size ) 
    { 
        this.Size = size; // &lt;-- Compile-Time Error!
    } 

    public int Size{get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error returned is  ""The 'this' object cannot be used before all of its fields are assigned to"". I know that this is standard procedure for a struct: the backing field for any property must be assigned directly (and not via the property's set accessor) from within the struct's constructor. </p>

<p>A solution is to use an explicit backing field:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyStruct
{ 
    public MyStruct(int size)
    {
        _size = size;
    }

    private int _size;

    public int Size
    {
        get { return _size; }
        set { _size = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that VB.NET would not have this issue, because in VB.NET all fields are automatically initialized to 0/null/false when first created.)</p>

<p>This would seem to be an unfortunate limitation when using automatic properties with structs in C#. Thinking conceptually, I was wondering if this wouldn't be a reasonable place for there to be an exception that allows the property set accessor to be called within a struct's constructor, at least for an automatic property?</p>

<p>This is a minor issue, almost an edge-case, but I was wondering what others thought about this...</p>

<p>For saving out crash dumps, I have a script passed to <code>cdb.exe</code> in the <code>Debugger</code> value of the <code>AeDebug</code> registry key:</p>

<pre><code>C:\progra~1\debugg~1\cdb.exe -p %ld -e %ld -g -y SRV*c:\mss*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols -c ""$&lt;d:\tgticker\Dumps\RDFD.cdbscript""
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the first portion of the script:</p>

<pre><code>as /c CrashFirstModule .printf ""%mu"", @@c++((*(ntdll!_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY**)&amp;@$peb-&gt;Ldr-&gt;InLoadOrderModuleList.Flink)-&gt;BaseDllName.Buffer) 

.logopen /t d:\tgticker\dumps\${CrashFirstModule}_process.log

* (...)
</code></pre>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>With symbols, this works exactly as I would like, I get log files with sensible names like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>LHCBDRDT.exe_process_147c_2009-01-06_23-10-05-371.log</code></li>
</ul>

<p>However, if symbols are not available, I get a log file name like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>${CrashFirstModule}_process_17a8_2009-01-06_23-10-01-124.log</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is because the alias command has failed to set the alias.  The alias command is one that I harvested from <a href=""http://www.dumpanalysis.org/blog/index.php/2008/08/13/generating-file-name-for-dump-command/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""DumpAnalysis.org: Generating file name for .dump command"">DumpAnalysis.org</a>.  This command pulls the name out of the PEB Header for the image, using <code>ntdll.dll</code>.  Without symbols for the OS, it doesn't know where to find the function it is calling from ntdll.dll.</p>

<h3>The Question</h3>

<p>Does anyone know or have a command to get the name of the image as an alias for use in filenames which would still work in these situations?</p>

<p>It kicks up what looks like a basic auth dialog, but instead of asking us to auth against Daily Control Module, it asks us to auth against the Windows server. And sure enough, the IIS server is asking for an NTLM auth. If I set the entire server to use Basic Auth, I get this from Fiddler:<br>

<p>Weird with the dual WWW-Auth headers, no? At any rate, authenticating using same unpw that works directly against Tomcat fails, whether I specify the domain or not. </p>

<p>I have to insert a couple million rows in either SQL Server 2000/2005, MySQL, or Access.  Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to use bulk insert or BCP or any of the other ways that a normal human would go about this.  The inserts will happen on one particular database but that code needs to be db agnostic -- so I can't do bulk copy, or SELECT INTO, or BCP.  I can however run specific queries before and after the inserts, depending on which database I'm importing to.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>If IsSqlServer() Then
    DisableTransactionLogging();
ElseIf IsMySQL() Then
    DisableMySQLIndices();
End If

... do inserts ...

If IsSqlServer() Then
    EnableTransactionLogging();
ElseIf IsMySQL() Then
    EnableMySQLIndices();
End If
</code></pre>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>Are there any interesting things I can do to SQL Server that might speed up these inserts?</p>

<p>For example, is there a command I could issue to tell SQL Server, ""Hey, don't bother recording these transactions in the transaction log"".</p>

<p>Or maybe I could say, ""Hey, I have a million rows coming in, so don't update your index until I'm totally finished"".</p>

<pre><code>ALTER INDEX [IX_TableIndex] ON Table DISABLE
     ... inserts
ALTER INDEX [IX_TableIndex] ON Table REBUILD
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: Above index disable only works on 2005, not 2000.  Bonus points if you know a way to do this on 2000).</p>

<p>What I wonder is: if I use this pattern with a WCF service, is the service the Model (DataModel), or do I need a separate Model to encapsulate the WCF service layer??</p>

<p>When I use WCF as DataModel my ViewModel is not testable without mocking the whole WCF service, since the calls to WCF need to manage the connection. The calls in this ViewModel look like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt; rc = null;
Service&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.IServiceWebsites&gt;.Use(alyzaSvc =&gt;
{
  rc = new List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt;(alyzaSvc.GetSites());
});
</code></pre>

<p>To get my ViewModel testable I tried adding a separate DataModel to abstract WCF connection away. After this the ViewModel was testable, the calls looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt; rc = new List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt;(_datamodel.GetSites());
</code></pre>

<p>Problem: most of the code that would need to be tested now had moved into the DataModel, which, again, needed WCF to be tested. What remained in the ViewModel was a thin shell, which can be tested. But since the main code moved into the DataModel, so testing the ViewModel was quite useless.</p>

<p>So to me it seems adding a separate DataModel layer to a View / ViewModel application using WCF does add a lot of work, but the testability does not get any better.</p>

Many of the dependencies were static, but because we want to test methods in isolation they are changed to instance members, like the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class ShortLivedThing {
   IDependency1 dep1;
   IDependency1 dep2;
   IDependency1 dep3;
   ...

   int TheRealData;

   // Constructor used in production 
   public ShortLivedThing() {
     dep1 = new Dep1(); dep2 = new Dep2(); dep3 = new Dep3();
   }

   // DI for testing 
   public ShortLivedThing(IDependency1 d1, IDependency2 d2, IDependency3 d3) { 
     dep1 = d1(); dep2 = d2(); dep3 = d3();
   }
}

<p>In turn the dependencies most of the time have other dependencies and so on.  This results in the instantiation of a tree of (mostly ""static"") objects <em>every time</em> a method call is done outside of tests.  Each of the objects are very small (just a few pointers), but the tree effect turns this into an ever increasing performance hit.</p>

<p>The reviewer was not keen that I change the code and I didn't but I do kind of agree with him. One reason given for not static-importing was it was confusing where the method was defined, it wasn't in the current class and not in any superclass so it too some time to identify its definition (the web based review system does not have clickable links like IDE :-) I don't really think this matters, static-imports are still quite new and soon we will all get used to locating them.</p>

<p>But the other reason, the one I agree with, is that an unqualified method call seems to belong to current object and should not jump contexts. But if it really did belong, it would make sense to extend that super class.</p>

<p>So, when <em>does</em> it make sense to static import methods? When have you done it? Did/do you like the way the unqualified calls look?</p>

<p>EDIT: The popular opinion seems to be that static-import methods if nobody is going to confuse them as methods of the current class. For example methods from java.lang.Math and java.awt.Color. But if abs and getAlpha are not ambiguous I don't see why readEmployee is. As in lot of programming choices, I think this too is a personal preference thing. </p>

<p>Thanks for your response guys, I am closing the question.</p>

It's my understanding that the primary use is to hamper a rainbow table attack.  However, the methods I've seen to implement this don't seem to really make the problem harder.</p>

<p>I've seen many tutorials suggesting that the salt be used as the following:</p>

<pre><code>$hash =  md5($salt.$password)
</code></pre>

<p>The reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password, but a combination of the password and the salt.  But say <code>$salt=foo</code> and <code>$password=bar</code> and <code>$hash=3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f</code>.  Now somebody with a rainbow table could reverse the hash and come up with the input ""foobar"".  They could then try all combinations of passwords (f, fo, foo, ... oobar, obar, bar, ar, ar).  It might take a few more milliseconds to get the password, but not much else.</p>

<p>The other use I've seen is on my linux system.  In the /etc/shadow the hashed passwords are actually stored <em>with</em> the salt.  For example, a salt of ""foo"" and password of ""bar"" would hash to this: <code>$1$foo$te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX1</code>.  If a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file, I don't see what purpose the salt serves, since the reverse hash of <code>te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX</code> is known to contain ""foo"".</p>

<p>Thanks for any light anybody can shed on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Thanks for the help.  To summarize what I understand, the salt makes the hashed password more complex, thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table.  What I misunderstood before was that I was assuming a rainbow table existed for ALL hashes.</p>

Today however, all my work items were gone from the list. I can select a suitable query from the drop down box and this works fine, so the projects are there.</p>

Need workaround,"<p>This really has my stumped today. I'm sure its simple, but... Here is my sample code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        public ArrayList SomeProp { get; set; }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Get the Type of a property by reflection.
            Type myPropType = typeof(Program).GetProperty(""SomeProp"").PropertyType;

            // Create an instance of the determined Type.
            var x = Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);

            // Now try to use that instance, passing to a method that takes a generic.
            WhatAmI(x);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        private static void WhatAmI&lt;T&gt;(T x)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""T is: "" + typeof(T).FullName);
            Console.WriteLine(""x is: "" + x.GetType().FullName);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output here is:</p>

<pre><code>T is: System.Object
x is: System.Collections.ArrayList
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what is going on here is I have some property on some class. It doesnt really matter what/where that comes from.  The important part is that I get the PropertyInfo for that property.  From there I create a new instance of its Type with Activator.</p>

<p>Now If I pass that created instance to a function that takes a generic parameter, the generic Type always comes across as Object, because Activator.CreateInstance() returns an Object, so ""var x"" is an Object, not, in this case, an ArrayList.</p>

<p>What I need to happen is for the generic type to be the actual type, int his case ""ArrayList"".</p>

<p>I know there is an Activator.CreateInstance() that I can use instead, but I can't use a Type (PropertyInfo.PropertyType) within the angle brackets for that method.</p>

<p>I could also just cast the returned object, like:</p>

<pre><code>myPropType x = (myPropType)Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);
</code></pre>

<p>But obviously that doesn't compile... Plus it wouldn't be valid anyway because the cast is compile time, and I don't know the type until runtime, but conceptually its what I need...</p>

<p>So I'm stuck with this Type, but I can't figure out how to get it passed over to the WhatAmI() method, and have T be ArrayList, not Object.</p>

<p>I tend to lean towards designing ASP.NET server controls rather than User Controls for use in my code.  I do this so that I can reuse them by drag and drop into WYSIWYG and just set the few pertinent properties.  This does cost a little extra in time designing the components, but simplifies things a lot when I come to using them in larger applications.</p>

<p>After having read that most developers seem to hand code rather than use WYSIWYG, it leads me to wonder: Am I wasting my time developing components this way?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify - mostly, the original intent has been that these controls are for my own use.  However, there have been a number of occasions when they could be useful for the rest of my team or potentially for public release.  However, like most things, I tend to see the huge potential extra value provided by comparatively little extra work regardless of the probability that the extra value will be realized.</p>

<p>Plus, there are all of the international characters, like umlauts, etc.</p>

<p>So, for an English-based system, what's the complete set? What about sets for other languages? What about UTF8, UTF16, etc?</p>

<p>Bonus question: How many name fields are needed, and what are their maximum lengths?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There are definitely two different types of characters involved in people's names, those that are there as part of the context, and those that are there for structural reasons. I don't want to limit or interfere with the context characters, but I do need to deal with the structural ones. </p>

<p>For example, I had a name come in that was separated by an em dash, but it was hard to distinguish that from the minus character. To make the system easier for searching, I want to take all five different types of dashes, and map them onto one unique character (minus), that way the searcher doesn't need to know specifically which symbol was initially entered. </p>

<p>The problem exists for dashes, probably quotes as well, but also how many other symbols?</p>

The query was performing really good without any table scans but when I encapsulated it within a stored procedure the performance was horrible. When I looked at the execution plan I could see that SQL Server picked a different plan that used a table scan instead of an index seek on TableB (I've been forced to obfuscate the table and column names a bit but none of the query logic has changed).</p>

<p>Here's the query</p>

<pre><code>SELECT     
    DATEADD(dd, 0, DATEDIFF(dd, 0, TableA.Created)) AS Day, 
    DATEPART(hh, TableA.Created) AS [Hour], 
    SUM(TableB.Quantity) AS Quantity, 
    SUM(TableB.Amount) AS Amount
FROM
    TableA
    INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.BID = TableB.ID
WHERE     
    (TableA.ShopId = @ShopId)
GROUP BY 
    DATEADD(dd, 0, DATEDIFF(dd, 0, TableA.Created)), 
    DATEPART(hh, TableA.Created)
ORDER BY 
    DATEPART(hh, TableA.Created)
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the query ""raw"" I get the following trace stats</p>

<pre>
Event Class         Duration  CPU  Reads Writes
SQL:StmtCompleted   75        41      7      0
</pre>

<p>And when I run the query as a stored proc using the following command</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @ShopId int
SELECT @ShopId = 1
EXEC spStats_GetSalesStatsByHour @ShopId
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following trace stats</p>

<pre>
Event Class         Duration  CPU  Reads Writes
SQL:StmtCompleted   222       10     48      0
</pre>

<p>I also get the same result if I store the query in an nvarchar and execute it using sp_executesql like this (it performs like the sproc)</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @SQL nvarchar(2000)
SET @SQL = 'SELECT DATEADD(dd, ...'
exec sp_executesql @SQL
</code></pre>

<p>The stored procedure does not contain anything except for the select statement above. What would cause sql server to pick an inferior execution plan just because the statement is executed as a stored procedure?</p>

<p>We're currently running on <strong>SQL Server 2000</strong></p>

The app manages other sub apps - users call in and the manager loads the assembly containing the correct application and invokes the workflow.</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing is that speech serve or iis like to lock the assembly into memory, preventing me from overwriting the dll. This makes it a pain to debug the app, but will also be totally unacceptable once the app is deployed to production.</p>

<p>There is no way to manually unload a single specific assembly - assemblies are only unloaded when their parent application domain unloads.</p>

<p>So I am trying to use .net remoting to create a new application domain, load the assembly into that domain, create the workflow object through a proxy, and then I want to pass that proxy around.</p>

<p>This is the code for the type that I am trying to create. It is in the assembly I am trying to load:</p>

<pre><code>public class typeContainer : MarshalByRefObject
{
    public static Type workflowType = typeof(mainWorkflow);

                ""namespace.typeContainer"");
object unwrapped = oh.Unwrap();

It's a bit like an Enterprise Bus, but it does a little more.</p>

<p>We decided to use Windows Workflow to handle the requests. As soon as we figure out what kind of action is requested, we'll start a workflow that is specifically designed to handled the action.
Now, some of the web services we'll call are asynchronous, so the workflow should wait for an answer.
The basic idea is that we'll implement the callback web service on our end and when the callback arrives 'somehow' give it's data to the running workflow that's waiting on the answer.</p>

<p>So far I've seen two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>the ExternalDataExchangeService</li>
<li>the WorkflowQueuingService</li>
</ol>

<p>The first service is relatively easy to use, but is event based, so if you miss the event, you miss the data. We need a queue-based solution, because it's technically possible to receive the callback from a web service even before we've gotten the synchronous response that tells us we'll get a callback shortly.</p>

<p>The second service seemed perfect, but it is very limiting in how it may be used.
Getting an item into the queue is very straightforward, but we need to make sure the queue exists before we can do that. And creating the queue seems only to be possible in the Execute override of an Activity.
Since we have a lot of different workflows, we have a base workflow class that does some work in it's Initialize override and would very much like to do the queue creation in there, so we won't have to create a special ""Initialize"" activity that every workflow should start with. We would also like to have the notification for when a new item is received to be in the base-class. So the specific workflow would only have to wait on an WaitHandle to know there is data on the queue.
Finally we want to be able to read the data from the queue from a Code Activity on the specific workflow (after the WaitHandle is signalled).</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea, doesn't have to be with the two services I mentioned, but we would really like to keep things as simple as possible.</p>

I am vaguely aware that there are all kinds of mathematical principles behind this kind of thing, and that it's very easy for subtle errors to make the whole algorithm ineffective if you try to roll it yourself.</p>

<p>So I'm looking for advice on a hashing/checksum algorithm with the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>It will be generated by Javascript, so needs to be relatively light computationally.</li>
<li>The validation will be done by Java (though I cannot see this actually being an issue).</li>
<li>It will take textual input (URL-encoded Unicode, which I believe is ASCII) of a moderate length; typically around 200-300 characters and in all cases below 2000.</li>
<li>The output should be ASCII text as well, and the shorter it can be the better.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm primarily interested in something lightweight rather than getting the absolute smallest potential for collisions possible.  Would I be naive to imagine that an eight-character hash would be suitable for this?  I should also clarify that it's not the end of the world if corruption isn't picked up at the validation stage (and I do realise that this will not be 100% reliable), though the rest of my code is markedly less efficient for every corrupt entry that slips through.</p>

<p>Edit - thanks to all that contributed.  I went with the Adler32 option and given that it was natively supported in Java, extremely easy to implement in Javascript, fast to calculate at both ends and have an 8-byte output it was exactly right for my requirements.</p>

<p>(Note that I realise that the network transport is unlikely to be responsible for any corruption errors and won't be folding my arms on this issue just yet; however adding the checksum validation removes one point of failure and means we can focus on other areas should this reoccur.)</p>

The particular issue that triggered this was an application that doesn't exit nicely because of a number of running threads. </p>

<p>Yes, I know you can daemonize the theads, and they won't then hold up the application exit. But it did get me to wondering if this was possible. The closest thing I can is the classloaders  (protected!) <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#findLoadedClass(java.lang.String)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">findLoadedClass</a>, although you'd have to run through your own classloader to do this. </p>

<p>On a related note, is this how profiling tools manage to track object handles? by running through their own custom classloaders? or is there some nice tricky way that I'm not seeing? </p>

<p>Well and I added a textbox which I use to add new child under the selected node and it works also good but so as to see the new added node, I have to refresh and page and all the expanded nodes collapses naturally. How can I prevent that. I am also using updatepanel not to refresh whole page and to expand child nodes I am using topicTree_TreeNodePopulate event of course. When users add something under the selected node , without any refreshment or postback the recently added node should be seen right under the selected page.</p>

<p>From the beginning... My SSIS package executes a SQL task that stores a max(date) from one table in variable User::max_date of type DateTime that has package scope.  </p>

<p>My package then proceeds to execute a Data Flow task which has a conditional split transformation in it that has the condition <code>date &gt; @[User::max_date]</code>.  The result set is always a single row which has the DateTime value equal to User::max_date, that is it returns the row that contains max(date) if no more rows have been added with more recent dates than max(date).  Which is the unexpected behaviour.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the other output from the conditional split is incorrect -- it's all the rows with <code>date &lt; @[User::max_date]</code> and not all the rows with <code>date &lt;= @[User::max_date]</code> as one would expect.</p>

<p>Why is this happening?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I've figured out how this is happening, but not why.  <code>User::max_date</code> is storing a DateTime and my <code>date</code> value from my Data Flow task is a <code>DT_DBTIMESTAMP</code>.  Upon comparing them with a <code>DATEDIFF(..)</code> they differ only at milliseconds and beyond.  </p>

<p>So I can work around the problem, but I have no idea why this would be implemented this way.</p>

I need to let people do things (creating records, looking at what they've created, etc), without actually creating an account. Once they create an account, everything persists without risk of losing it by clearing cookies or something.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm thinking it's pretty straightforward. Have an is_anonymous field in the User model, and use something like this to access the currently logged in user:</p>

<pre><code>def find_user
  session[:user_id] ||= create_new_anonymous_user.id
end

<p>Assuming the session persists for some reasonable period of time, and the session cookie doesn't expire, that should keep everything running smoothly.</p>

<p>However, there is this piece of me that is convinced that I'm missing something security-related. Has anyone done something like this before? Am I missing something super-obvious?</p>

Then I thought that maybe c types were enough to deal with my values. Yet, I was advised in the iPhone SDK forum to use NSDecimalNumber, because of its excellent rounding capabilities. </p>

<p>Not being a mathematician by temperament, I thought that the mantissa/exponent paradigm might be overkill; still, googlin' around, I realised that most talks about money/currency in cocoa were referred to NSDecimalNumber.</p>

<p>Notice that the app I am working on is going to be internationalised, so the option of counting the amount in cents is not really viable, for the monetary structure depends greatly on the locale used.</p>

<p>I am 90% sure that I need to go with NSDecimalNumber, but since I found no unambiguous answer on the web (something like: ""if you deal with money, use NSDecimalNumber!"") I thought I'd ask here. Maybe the answer is obvious to most, but I want to be sure before starting a massive re-factoring of my app. </p>

<p>I have been successful with this example (conceptually taken from <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/andreww/archive/2008/10/13/exposing-events-from-managed-add-in-objects.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blogs.msdn.com/andreww/archive/2008/10/13/exposing-events-from-managed-add-in-objects.aspx</a>):</p>

<p>// The delegate type for our custom event.</p>

<pre><code>[ComVisible(false)]
public delegate void SomeEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);

// Outgoing (source/event) interface.
[ComVisible(true)]
[InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIDispatch)]
public interface IAddInEvents
{
    [DispId(1)]
    void SomeEvent(object sender, EventArgs e);
}

[ComVisible(true)]
[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]
[ComSourceInterfaces(typeof(IAddInEvents))]
public class AddInUtilities :
{       
    // Event field. This is what a COM client will hook up
    // their sink to.
    public event SomeEventHandler SomeEvent;

    inernal void FireEvent(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (SomeEvent != null)
        {
            SomeEvent(sender, e);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, because the IAddInEvents interface is defined as <strong>IDispatch</strong>. However, I need to <strong>publish an event source interface which is IUnknown</strong>. I do not have control over the event interface as it comes from a third-party library (which will also be the consumer of the published events). Whenever I try to hook to the events, VB environment (where I am trying to sink the events) crashes, so does the VBA environment which the third-party product (ESRI ArcMap) uses.</p>

<p>I have been able to (partially) implement <strong>IConnectionPointContainer</strong> interface (which COM uses in the background to handle events) manually, then I am able to sink the event and step into my IConnectionPointContainer implementation. However, this seems like an overkill to me and I think that there must an implicit support for this in .NET. Second, with this approach I instantly lose the delegate support.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience with this?
Thanks in advance.</p>

In some circumstances, I'd like to forward along a managed object to MAXScript for direct interaction, i.e. return a wrapped object from one of my functions.</p>

<p>MAXScript is able to manipulate managed objects directly relatively well through another plugin (msxdotNet) included with Max (I'm using 3ds Max 2008). It basically wraps an object and uses reflection for late bound calls, but it is totally self contained and doesn't have any sdk exposure. The plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by Max for adding a few top level scripted classes.</p>

<p>The scripted classes allow one to instantiate a new object via a constructor</p>

<pre><code>local inst = (dotNetObject ""MyPlugin.MyClass"" 0 0 ""arg3"")

<p>In my case I already have an instance of an object that I'd like to use. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to construct an instance of a dotNetObject wrapper from within my plugin to return to Max?</strong></p>

<p>Idealy, I'd like to have a helper function with a (C++/CLI) signature similar to:</p>

<pre><code>Value* WrapObject(System::Object ^obj);

<p>Some basic guarantees that I can make:</p>

<ul>
<li>The msxdotNet plugin is already loaded.</li>
<li>The msxdotNet plugin and my managed assemblies are in the same AppDomain.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source for the msxdotNet plugin <em>is</em> included as an sdk sample, but for management/sanity's sake, modifying it and recompiling it is not an option.</p>

Currently this is done through a big if-else statement along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>if (obj instanceOf X)
{
    //code to initialize internal object
}
else if (obj instanceOf Y)
{
    //code to initialize different object
}
else if (obj instanceOf Z)
{
    //more init code
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I don't find this solution satisfactory; it's long and messy and to make matters worse many of the if-else blocks contain more if-else blocks dealing with subclasses and edge cases. Is there a better solution to this problem?</p>

<pre><code>try { return x; } finally { x = null; }
</code></pre>

<p>I mean, does the <code>finally</code> clause really execute <em>after</em> the <code>return</code> statement? How thread-unsafe is this code? Can you think of any additional hackery that can be done w.r.t. this <code>try-finally</code> hack?</p>

I tried making it multi-threaded (using ThreadPool.QueueWorkItem) where the SmsMessage was passed along.   However, I noticed that when I did that, the program would only handle the first sms event - afterwards, NO SMS were received by the device at all!   But when the program exits, then all the missed SMSs arrived.</p>

<p>Based on that, I'd guess that the answer to my question is that SmsMessage objects are NOT thread-safe, even though there's not really an indication that that's the case.</p>

<p>So what if we want to try and thread an SmsMessage Object?   I'll try that out tonight by making a copy of the SmsMessage (probably by using the constructor w/ item id), or I'll create an empty one and copy the fields manually.</p>

<p>DISCOVERY:</p>

<p>I narrowed down my problem.   I was able to get everything to work in a background thread when I copied the SmsMessage into my own object, taking care not to reference any of the SmsMessage's objects.   SMSs went flying through with no problem.</p>

<p>However, when I set up an MessageIntercepter to launch an application, and within that application instance, use a background thread to send an SMS, the application would work fine, but after it exits my code it crashes and displays the ""There was an error in yourapp.exe"" and asks me if you want to send the crash data to MS.   I could never figure out what that error was, but I found out that if I sent the SMS from the same thread that launched the application, everything worked fine.</p>

<p>So, threading when the app is open = fine, as long as you don't pass/use the SmsMessage
Threading when the app is externally launched = fine, as long as you don't send an SmsMessage in another thread.</p>

<p>This allows the follow code:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(...)));
...
br.close();
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice, since we don't need a reference to <code>FileInputStream</code> and remember to close it.</p>

<p>But does it also work for <code>FileLock</code>s?</p>

<pre><code>final FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File(""buffer.txt""));
final FileChannel c = fis.getChannel();
final FileLock lock = c.lock(0L, Long.MAX_VALUE, true);
final BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fis));

try {
    while(br.ready()) {
        System.out.println(br.readLine());
    }
} finally {
    br.close();
}

<p>I've tried this code and the lock is correctly released when <code>br.close()</code> is called, but is is safe to do so?  The <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Closeable.html#close()"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Closeable JavaDoc</a> says, <em>""Closes this stream and releases any system resources associated with it.""</em>  Am I safe to assume that I am using <code>close()</code> as specified to <code>release()</code> the lock?</p>

If I write the code this way, it won't compile.  Since that probably doesn't make sense, let me give a code example:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseReturnType { }
class DerivedReturnType : BaseReturnType { }

abstract class BaseClass {
    public abstract BaseReturnType PolymorphicMethod();
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass {
    // Compile Error: return type must be 'BaseReturnType' to match 
    // overridden member 'BaseClass.PolymorphicMethod()'
    public override DerivedReturnType PolymorphicMethod() { 
        return new DerivedReturnType(); 
    }
}

<p>Is there any way to accomplish this in C#?  If not, what's the best way to achieve something similar?  And why isn't it allowed?  It doesn't seem to allow any logical inconsistency, since any object returned from the over-ridden method still <code>is BaseReturnType</code>.  Maybe there is something I hadn't considered though.  Or maybe the reason is technological or historical.</p>

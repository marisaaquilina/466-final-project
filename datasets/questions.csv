2490.0,22587,6,11,2008-08-22,22528,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22528/php-includes-vs-oop,PHP includes vs OOP,"<p>I would like to have a reference for the pros and cons of using include <strong>files vs objects(classes)</strong> when developing PHP applications.</p>

<p>I know I would benefit from having one place to go for this answer...I have a few opinions of my own but I look forward to hearing others.</p>

<p><strong>A Simple Example:</strong></p>

<p>Certain pages on my site are only accessible to logged in users. I have two options for implementation (there are others but let's limit it to these two)</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Create an authenticate.php file and include it on every page. It holds the logic for authentication.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Create a user object, which has an authenticate function, reference the object for authentication on every page.</em> </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I'd like to see some way weigh the benefits of one over the other. 
My current (and weak reasons) follow:</p>

<p>Includes - Sometimes a function is just easier/shorter/faster to call
Objects - Grouping of functionality and properties leads for longer term maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Includes</strong> - Less code to write (no constructor, no class syntax) call me lazy but this is true.</p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong> - Force formality and a single approach to functions and creation. </p>

<p><strong>Includes</strong> - Easier for a novice to deal with
Objects - Harder for novices, but frowned upon by professionals.</p>

<p>I look at these factors at the start of a project to decide if I want to do includes or objects.
Those are a few pros and cons off the top of my head.</p>

My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<pre><code>if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<pre><code>where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>

Treat me as (sigh) an alien that has just landed on the planet, albeit one that knows PHP and a few optimisation techniques.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm developing a tool in <strong>PHP</strong> that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p>

<p>My question on this:</p>

<p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>

<li>Any personal experience in overcoming web application performance hurdles? </li>
<li>Any recommended strategies for improving the performance of a data-driven web application? </li>
</ul>

<p>My development team works on a web application (JSP reports, HTML, JavaScript) that uses an Oracle database (PL/SQL). The key functionality the application delivers is in reporting, where a user can get PDFs of reports at a high level and drill down to lower levels of supporting details. </p>

<p>As the number of supporting detail records has grown into the millions, the performance of the system has significantly degraded. Based on our current analysis of the metrics, the bottleneck seems to be in the logic hitting the DB and the DB performance. Changing the DB model and re-doing some of the server side logic is currently being explored.  </p>

<p>Partioning, indexing, explain plans, and running statistics are things that have been done on the DB side to try to help improve performance. While they've helped, they haven't solved the issue satisfactorily. The toughest part in analyzing performance data is that the database and web servers are remotely administered by a different part of the IT organization, so the developers don't have regular, full access to see what's going on (especially in the production environment, which is not mirrored exactly in any other development/testing environment).  </p>

<p>Is the best answer to use SSL/HTTPS encryption for the entire web site, and you have the best guarantee that no man in the middle attacks will be able to sniff an existing client session cookie?</p>

<p>And perhaps second best to use some sort of encryption on the session value itself that is stored in your session cookie?</p>

<p>If a malicious user has physical access to a machine, they can still look at the filesystem to retrieve a valid session cookie and use that to hijack a session?</p>

<p>So...you have four or five RDP sessions open over the corp VPN, you're bashing away inside your favourite IDE, your VPN to the data centre bounces briefly then recovers, all your RDP sessions start re-establishing their connections and whilst doing so sequentially keep grabbing focus, one after the other.

I tried <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/Terminals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Terminals</a> a few times before, but quite often I need to see two or three sessions side by side which the tabbing doesn't really facilitate too well, would've been nice to have a 'pop out in own window' button. I did once grab the source code to fix stuff like that, but never got the time. I also found it behaved oddly whenever there was a brief network disconnect (e.g. xDSL flapping) and it would reconnect to the wrong session (usually a new one) and leave the session I had opened in a disconnected state on the server. Otherwise Terminals would've been really cool, we have 200+ windows servers, and organising all those .rdp files can be a pain.</p>

I've defined my message class accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts-as-readable
end
</code></pre>

<p>And everything seems to be working according to plan, but when trying to make the app show unread messages in my message view, I run into problems.</p>

<p>Their example: (I've changed underscores to hyphens due to formatting issues)</p>

<pre><code>bob = User.find_by_name(""bob"")

bob.readings                      # =&gt; []

Post.find_unread_by(bob)          # =&gt; [&lt;Post 1&gt;,&lt;Post 2&gt;,&lt;Post 3&gt;...]
Post.find_read_by(bob)            # =&gt; []

Post.find(1).read_by?(bob)        # =&gt; false
Post.find(1).read_by!(bob)        # =&gt; &lt;Reading 1&gt;
Post.find(1).read_by?(bob)        # =&gt; true
Post.find(1).users_who_read       # =&gt; [&lt;User bob&gt;]

Post.find_unread_by(bob)          # =&gt; [&lt;Post 2&gt;,&lt;Post 3&gt;...]
Post.find_read_by(bob)            # =&gt; [&lt;Post 1&gt;]

bob.readings                      # =&gt; [&lt;Reading 1&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems that if I wanted to list the number of unread messages sitting in a mailbox (for example Inbox (39) ), I should be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Post.find_unread_by(current-user).count %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But to no avail.  I always seem to get stuck on the simple view issues after everything's set.
Any ideas?</p>

(Or maybe I fail at reading comprehension.)  Here's a small reproduction.</p>

cd empty
echo '* text=auto !eol' &gt; .gitattributes

git config core.autocrlf false # I guess git attributes overrides this anyway?
git add t.txt # wait what?  warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in t.txt???  I thought git likes LF?
git commit -m 'the plot thickens'
git cat-file -p `git rev-parse HEAD:t.txt` &gt; temp.txt # get raw blob as its really stored, I hope
od -c t.txt # original file in working dir ends in LF
od -c temp.txt # file from git also ends in LF, despite git warning??
# end of script

<p>Does this make any sense?  I thought that git sometimes likes to convert CRLF to plain LF on &quot;git add&quot; and does the reverse on checkout, but I've never heard of it turning plain LF into CRLF on git add, as the warning seems to threaten.  And then it doesn't do it.  The file that gets checked in is exactly what I have in my working directory, as verified by cat-file.  So why warn at all?  What's going on?</p>

When the form loads, the text boxes are populated from a database.<br>
The user can change the populated values, and when they submit the form, I take the values posted to the server and conditionally save them (determined by some business logic).<br>
All but 1 of the text boxes work as intended.</p>

<p>The odd box out, upon postback, does not contain the updated value that the user typed into the box.<br>
When debugging the application, it is clear that <code>myTextBox.Text</code> reflects the old, pre-populated value, not the new, user-supplied value.<br>
Every other box properly shows their respective user-supplied values.</p>

<p>I did find a workaround.<br>
My solution was to basically extract the text box's value out of the <code>Request.Form</code> object:   <code>Request.Form[myTextBox.UniqueID]</code>, which does contain the user-supplied value.</p>

<p>What could be going on, here?<br>
As I mentioned, the other text boxes receive the user-supplied values just fine, and this particular problematic text box doesn't have any logic associated to it -- it just takes the value and saves it.<br>
The main difference between this text box and the others is that this is a multi-line box (for inputting notes), which I believe is rendered as an HTML ""textarea"" tag instead of an ""input"" tag in ASP.NET.</p>

When we create a window, our normal practice is to put <code>this</code> in the window's user data area via <code>SetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_USERDATA, this)</code>, which allows us to have an MFC-like callback or a tightly integrated <code>WndProc</code>, depending.  The problem is that this will not work on Win64, since LONG is only 32-bits wide.  What's a better solution to this problem that works on both 32- and 64-bit systems?</p>

I do way better with books than web sites, but when I visit the local book store the books on LISP look kind of scary.</p>

<p>So what's a good starting point?  My goal is to be able to use a functional programming language to solve simple problems in 6 months or so, and the ability to move to more advanced topics, recognize when a functional language is the right tool for the job, and use the language to solve more problems over the course of 2-3 years.  I like books that are heavy on examples but also include challenges to work through.  Does such a thing exist for functional languages?</p>

It uses a copula, if any are familiar with that.  I need to sum up the values in the array based on which dimensions are &quot;cared about.&quot;</p>
<p>Example:  Consider the following example...</p>
<pre>
Dimension 0 (across)
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 2 _|  Dimension 1
|_ 1 _|_ 0 _|_ 2 _|_ 0 _|   (down)
|_ 0 _|_ 3 _|_ 0 _|_ 6 _|
|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|_ 0 _|

I ""care about"" dimension 0 only, and ""don't care"" about the rest (dim 1).
Summing this array with the above specifications will
""collapse"" the ""stacks"" of dimension 1 down to a single 4 x 1 array:

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
|_ 1 _|_ 3 _|_ 2 _|_ 8 _|

This can then be summed, or have any operation performed.
</pre>
<p>I need to do this with an array of 'n' dimensions, which could feasibly be 20. Also, I need to be able to do this, caring about certain dimensions, and collapsing the rest.  I am having an especially hard time with this because I cant visualize 20 dimensions :p . If anyone could help me set up some c/c++ code to collapse/sum, I would be very very grateful.</p>
<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>Just got home.  Here is some info to answer your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sorry for rolling back the edits, I was hoping when I clicked roll-back it would show me the changes so I could see what I messed up, a bit like wikipedia.  This wasn't the case, as I found out.</li>
<li>@jeff - What doesnt make sense?  I am using this great service for (what I think is) a legit reason.  I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li>
<li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a &quot;driver&quot; function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array.</li>
<li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks everyone for your imput.</p>

<p>Notice that these errors are coming from the legacy code, not my code - app_main.obj is part of the legacy code, while mymain.c is my source.  I've done some searching around, and what that I've read says that this type of error is caused by a mismatch with the -MD switch between my code and the library that I'm linking to.  Since I'm dealing with legacy code, a solution has to come from my environment. It's been a long time since I've done C++ work, and even longer since I've used Visual Studio, so I'm hoping that this is just some ignorance on my part.  Any ideas on how to get these resolved?</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33577341/visual-studio-2015-c-and-assembly-not-building"">answer</a> says the project is being linked with only part of the C runtime (CRT) libary, <code>msvcrtd.lib</code>. I also need to link with the libraries <code>vcruntimed.lib</code> and <code>ucrtd.lib</code>. </p>

<p>Good, but how?</p>

<p>The apitest is a solution based on many projects, I guess I have to manually add something into the SDL2 one. I tried a lot of attempts, especially under Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies, but I never got it working</p>

<p>I found <code>msvcrtd.lib</code> under <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\lib</code> although I guess the solution is trying to build its own.</p>

<p>I found <code>vcruntimed.lib</code> under the same place as <code>msvcrtd.lib</code>. Instead <code>ucrtd.lib</code> is located under <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.10240.0\ucrt\x64</code></p>

<p>Thanks in advance..</p>

<p>Ps: I have VS15 Community Edition</p>

<p>I'm thinking the most efficient would be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find lowest prime number that divides cleanly</li>
<li>Check if result of division is prime</li>
<li>If not, find next lowest</li>
<li>Go to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm basing this assumption on it being easier to calculate the small prime factors. Is this about right? What other approaches should I look into?</p>

<p>Edit: I've now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play, since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes, therefore a recursive algorithm is needed.</p>

<p>Edit again: And now I've realised that this does still work, because the last found prime number has to be the highest one, therefore any further testing of the non-prime result from step 2 would result in a smaller prime.</p>

<li>Do nothing and hope that two users are never going to be editing the same record at the same time. <em>- Might never happed but what if it does?</em></li>

<li>Add last updated DATETIME column and check it matches when we update, if not then show differences. <em>- requires new column in each of the relevant tables.</em></li>

I'm designing the security side of our project, to allow us to have different versions of the program for different costs and also to allow Manager-type users to grant or deny access to parts of the program to other users.  Its going to web-based and hosted on our servers.</p>

<p>I'm using a simple Allow or Deny option for each 'Resource' or screen.</p>

<p>We're going to have a large number of resources, and the user will be able to set up many different groups to put users in to control access.  Each user can only belong to a single group.</p>

<p>I've got two approaches to this in mind, and was curious which would be better for the SQL server in terms of performance.</p>

<p><strong>Option A</strong>
The presence of an entry in the access table means access is allowed.  This will not need a column in the database to store information.  If no results are returned, then access is denied.</p>

<p>I think this will mean a smaller table, but would queries search the whole table to determine there is no match?</p>

<p><strong>Option B</strong>
A bit column is included in the database that controls the Allow/Deny.  This will mean there is always a result to be found, and makes for a larger table.</p>

It is basically a singleton that works as a client and I am not sure of my Kotlin implementation. UserAPI and ProfileAPI are just interfaces.</p>

<pre><code>public class RetrofitService {

private ProfileAPI profileAPI;
private UserAPI userAPI;
private static RetrofitService INSTANCE;

/**

    return userAPI;

<p>And this is my Kotlin implementation. As I understand this, the init block will be executed first when the class is instantiated.</p>

<pre><code>class RetrofitService private constructor() {
/**
 * Method that returns the API
 * @return
 */
private val profileApi: ProfileAPI
private val userAPI: UserAPI

companion object {

        if (INSTANCE == null) {

        }
        return INSTANCE
    }
}

init {
    val mRetrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
            .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
            .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapterFactory.create())

    profileApi = mRetrofit.create(ProfileAPI::class.java)
    UserAPI = mRetrofit.create(UserAPI::class.java)
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>But something tells me this is not the right way or it can be done better. Is there anything I can improve here? </p>

<p>UPDATE!!!</p>

<p>Based on comments and answer I have this implementation now</p>

<pre><code>object RetrofitService {
private const val BASE_URL = ""https://test.api.com""

private fun retrofitService(): Retrofit {
    return Retrofit.Builder()
            .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
            .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapterFactory.create())
            .baseUrl(BASE_URL)
            .build()
}

val profileApi: ProfileAPI by lazy {
    retrofitService().create(ProfileAPI::class.java)
}

val userApi: UserAPI by lazy {
    retrofitService().create(UserAPI::class.java)

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would use it like this</p>

<pre><code>RetrofitService.profileApi
</code></pre>

<p>Would that be alright?</p>

257.0,1073,15,63,2008-08-04,1069,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1069/heap-corruption-under-win32-how-to-locate,Heap corruption under Win32; how to locate?,"<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.  I want to catch the vandal in the act.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe these tools will allow you at least to narrow the problem to certain component.</p>

openRequest.addEventListener('error', () =&gt; {
    console.error('Unable to open db');

openRequest.addEventListener('upgradeneeded', function(event){
    var store = db.createObjectStore('myStore', 
        {keyPath: /* composite key */ }
    );
});
openRequest.addEventListener('success', function(){
    db = openRequest.result;
});

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor?</p>

<p>HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the ""No Setup, Just Extract and Run"" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem.</p>

<p>So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make.</p>

<p>CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.</p>

It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
    int searchLen = strlen(search);
    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
    char *find = input;

    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {

        if (delta &gt; 0) {
            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
            find = strstr(input, search);            
        }

        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

int main(void) {
    char *input = malloc(81);

    while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) {
        strrep(input, ""Noel"", ""Christmas"");
    }
}

<p>A dict of dicts is more flexible and simpler to implement, but I intuitively expect a list of lists to be faster. The list option would also require that I keep the data separate from the structure, while dicts would allow for something of the sort:</p>

<p>What would you suggest?</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, I should have been a bit clearer on what I mean by efficiency. In this particular case I mean it in terms of random access retrieval.</p>

<p>Loading the data in to memory isn't a huge problem. That's done once and for all. The time consuming part is visiting the nodes so I can extract the information and measure the metrics I'm interested in.</p>

<p>I hadn't considered making each node a class (properties are the same for all nodes) but it seems like that would add an extra layer of overhead? I was hoping someone would have some direct experience with a similar case that they could share. After all, graphs are one of the most common abstractions in CS.</p>

<p><code>MailException</code> could be thrown for a number of reasons, problems with the email address, problems with the mail template etc.</p>

<p>My code would want to react differently to each of these issues (mostly by changing the message returned to the client, but actual logic as well).</p>

<p>Would it be best to have an exception implementation for each one of these issues or one umbrella exception that had something internal to it (an enum say) that let the code distinguish what kind of issue it was.</p>

I'm implementing an MVP architecture because I'm sick of Winforms and wanted something that had a better separation of concerns.</p>

<p>So with MVP, the Presenter handles events raised by the View. Here's some code that I have in place to deal with the creation of users:</p>

<pre><code>public class CreateMemberPresenter
{
    private ICreateMemberView view;
    private IMemberTasks tasks;

    public CreateMemberPresenter(ICreateMemberView view) 
        : this(view, new StubMemberTasks())

    {
        this.view = view;
        this.tasks = tasks;

        HookupEventHandlersTo(view);
    }

    private void HookupEventHandlersTo(ICreateMemberView view)
    {
        view.CreateMember += delegate { CreateMember(); };
    }

    private void CreateMember()
    {
        if (!view.IsValid)
            return;

        try
        {
            int newUserId;
            tasks.CreateMember(view.NewMember, out newUserId);
            view.NewUserCode = newUserId;
            view.Notify(new NotificationDTO() { Type = NotificationType.Success });
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            this.LogA().Message(string.Format(""Error Creating User: {0}"", e.Message));
            view.Notify(new NotificationDTO() { Type = NotificationType.Failure, Message = ""There was an error creating a new member"" });
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have my main form validation done using the built in .Net Validation Controls, but now I need to verify that the data sufficiently satisfies the criteria for the Service Layer.</p>

<p>Let's say the following Service Layer messages can show up:</p>

<ul>
<li>E-mail account already exists (failure)</li>
<li>Refering user entered does not exist (failure)</li>
<li>Password length exceeds datastore allowed length (failure)</li>
<li>Member created successfully (success)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's also say that more rules will be in the service layer that the UI cannot anticipate.</p>

<p>Currently I'm having the service layer throw an exception if things didn't go as planned. Is that a sufficent strategy? Does this code smell to you guys? If I wrote a service layer like this would you be annoyed at having to write Presenters that use it in this way? Return codes seem too old school and a bool is just not informative enough.</p>

  <p><strong>Edit not by OP: merging in follow-up comments that were posted as answers by the OP</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Cheekysoft, I like the concept of a ServiceLayerException. I already have a global exception module for the exceptions that I don't anticipate. Do you find making all these custom exceptions tedious? I was thinking that catching base Exception class was a bit smelly but wasn't exactly sure how progress from there.</p>

<p>tgmdbm, I like the clever use of the lambda expression there!</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Cheekysoft for the follow-up. So I'm guessing that would be the strategy if you don't mind the user being displayed a separate page (I'm primarily a web developer) if the Exception is not handled.</p>

<p>However, if I want to return the error message in the same view where the user submitted the data that caused the error, I would then have to catch the Exception in the Presenter?</p>

<p>Here's what the CreateUserView looks like when the Presenter has handled the ServiceLayerException:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOJU7.png"" alt=""Create a user""></p>

<p>For this kind of error, it's nice to report it to the same view. </p>

<p>Anyways, I think we're going beyond the scope of my original question now. I'll play around with what you've posted and if I need further details I'll post a new question.</p>

Now, I would like to update it so that the server can actually send a message to the client to request data.  As I currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server, this doesn't allow for the server to send a request at any time.  I would have to wait for client data.  My first thought would be to create another thread on the client with a separate open socket, listening for server requests...just like the server already has in respect the client.  Is there a way, within the same thread and using the same socket, to all the server to send requests at any time?</p>

They can be opened in separate windows, or docked into tabs in the main window.</p>

<p>If I open a modal dialog from one of the separate forms, the main form is brought to the front, and is shown as the selected window in the windows taskbar. Say the main form is the WYSIWYG view, and the source view is poped out. You go to a particular point in the source view and insert an image tag. A dialog appears to allow you to select and enter the properties you want for the image. If the WYSIWYG view and the source view overlap, the WYSIWYG view will be brought to the front and the source view is hidden. Once the dialog is dismissed, the source view comes back into sight.</p>

<p>I've tried setting the owner and the ParentWindow properties to the form it is related to:</p>

<blockquote><code>dialog := TDialogForm.Create( parentForm );<br>
  dialog.ParentWindow := parentForm.Handle;
</code></blockquote>

<p>How can I fix this problem? What else should I be trying?</p>

<p>Given that people seem to be stumbling on my example, perhaps I can try with a better example: a text editor that allows you to have more than one file open at the same time. The files you have open are either in tabs (like in the Delphi IDE) or in its own window. Suppose the user brings up the spell check dialog or the find dialog. What happens, is that if the file is being editing in its own window, that window is sent to below the main form in the z-order when the modal dialog is shown; once the dialog is closed, it is returned to its original z-order.</p>

<p>I've looked into using the <code>__autoload</code> function, but hat doesn't seem to work well if you plan to have your  class files organized in a directory tree.  If you did this, it seems like you'd end up walking the directory tree until you found the class you were looking for.  <strong><em>Also, I'm not sure how this effects classes with the same name in different namespaces.</em></strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Is there an easier way to handle this?</strong>  </p>

<p>Or is PHP just not suited to ""<strong>enterprisey</strong>"" type applications with lots of different objects all located in separate files that can be in many different directories.</p>

However I would be interested in advice about when to use one or the other (or neither possibly).<br>
The <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/textsearch-indexes.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">PostgreSQL documentation</a> has some information about this:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIN index lookups are about three times faster than GiST</li>
<li>GIN indexes take about three times longer to build than GiST</li>
<li>GIN indexes are about ten times slower to update than GiST</li>
<li>GIN indexes are two-to-three times larger than GiST</li>
</ul>

<p>However I would be particularly interested to know if there is a performance impact when the memory to index size ration starts getting small (ie. the index size becomes much bigger than the available memory)? I've been told on the #postgresql IRC channel that GIN needs to keep all the index in memory, otherwise it won't be effective, because, unlike B-Tree, it doesn't know which part to read in from disk for a particular query? The question would be: is this true (because I've also been told the opposite of this)? Does GiST have the same restrictions? Are there other restrictions I should be aware of while using one of these indexing algorithms?</p>

I primarily use ASP.NET / VB.NET with SQL Server 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>I want to offer a dynamic permission system that can work on different parameters. Let's say that I want to give either a department or just a specific person access to an application. And pretend that we have a number of applications that keeps growing.</p>
<p>In the past, I have chosen one of the following two ways that I know to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use a single permission table with special columns that are used for
determining a how to apply the parameters. The special columns in
this example are <code>TypeID</code> and <code>TypeAuxID</code>. The SQL would look something
like this.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(PermissionID)
FROM application_permissions
WHERE
(TypeID = 1 AND TypeAuxID = @UserID) OR
(TypeID = 2 AND TypeAuxID = @DepartmentID)
AND ApplicationID = 1

</li>
<li><p>Use a mapping table for each type of permission, then joining them
all together.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(perm.PermissionID)
FROM application_permissions perm
LEFT JOIN application_UserPermissions emp
ON perm.ApplicationID = emp.ApplicationID
LEFT JOIN application_DepartmentPermissions dept
ON perm.ApplicationID = dept.ApplicationID
WHERE q.SectionID=@SectionID
  AND (emp.UserID=@UserID OR dept.DeptID=@DeptID OR
 (emp.UserID IS NULL AND dept.DeptID IS NULL)) AND ApplicationID = 1
ORDER BY q.QID ASC

<p>The first example requires less work, but neither of them feel like the best answer. Is there a better way to handle this?</p>

The app is not very structured with no unit tests. So any change will be risky. I'm obviously concerned that I've got a good enough reason to change. The idea is that there will be less boiler plate code for data access and there for greater productivity.</p>

Is it possible or even a good idea to phase it in?<br>

<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>

<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>

<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));
bool success = false;
while (!success)
{
    try
    {
        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail
        success = true;
    }
    catch (IOException e)
    {
        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)
        {
            throw e;
        }
        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>

<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()
    {
        // some code block
    } );
</code></pre>

<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.</p>

The animation is <strong>non-repeating</strong> and consist in a fixed (and pre-defined) amount of frames with some fixed interval beetween them. It is meant to run once.</p>

<p>I'm aware that the method <code>plt.show()</code> can be made into non-blocking call by writing <code>plt.show(block=False)</code>, but that doesn't completely solve my problem. I haven't been able to get any information here on StackOverflow and other sites regarding how the library dispose that information of this <strong>event</strong> or so, in order to allow me to call <code>plt.close()</code>.</p>

<p>I'm seaching for a pythonic way of doing this, instead of my current solution which is far from good. Here's my ""solution"":</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import numpy as np

    ax.clear()

INTERVAL = 100

anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, interval=INTERVAL, frames=FRAMES_NUM, repeat=False)

C++ applications on Linux?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not looking for a <em>lightweight</em> IDE. If an IDE is worth the money, then I will pay for it, so it need not be free.</p>

<p>My question, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">intellisense</a> or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic
breakpoints).</p>

<p>I have searched for it myself, but there are so many that it is almost impossible to separate the good from the bads by hand, especially for someone like me who has little  C++ coding experience in Linux. I know that <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eclipse supports C++</a>, and I really like that IDE for Java, but is it any good for C++ and is there something better?</p>

<p>The second post actually has some good suggestions, but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user, what are its (dis)advantages?</p>

<p>Maybe my question should therefore be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What IDE do you propose (given your experiences), and why?</em></p>

<p>Assuming that somebody doesn't come out and show that classes are too slow, it looks like class wins.</p>

<p>I've not idea which answer I should accept to I've just upvoted all of them.</p>

<hr>

<p>And I have now written two near identical pages, one using the 2D array (written before this question was posted) and now one using a class and I must say that the class produces much nicer code. I have no idea how much overhead is going to be generated but I doubt it will rival the improvement to the code itself.</p>

I encountered one last night when working with Master Pages: my <code>&lt;asp:BulletedList ID=""nav""&gt;</code>, when converted into HTML, became <code>&lt;ul id=""ct100_nav""&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>There are other issues--I noticed that when you auto-populate a DataGrid, it adds attributes to the resulting table that I don't necessarily want there.</p>

<p>I know that there is a certain amount of ""convention over configuration"" that you have to accept when you rely on a framework to take over some of your tedious duties, but the ""conventions"" in these cases aren't so much any established conventions, but rather unnecessary extras. I know <em>why</em> the ID adds the prefix, but I should be able to tweak and turn things like this off, especially since, as a bit of a web standards evangelist, I don't duplicated HTML id's in a single page anyway.</p>

<p>So the question here is for those ASP.NET devs more seasoned than I: in your experiences in developing and deploying apps, how do you leverage these controls? Do you find yourself resorting back to hard-coded HTML? Do you use a blend? I don't want to design my HTML around idiosyncratic quirks in these controls, but, if possible, I'd like to leverage them when possible. </p>

<p>The aluminium extrusions come in lengths of 5m.</p>

<p>I have a list of smaller lengths that need to be cut from the 5m lengths of aluminium extrusions.</p>

<p>The smaller lengths need to be cut in the order that produces the least amount of off cut waste from the 5m lengths of aluminium extrusions.</p>

<p>Currently I order the cutting list in such a way that generally the longest of the smaller lengths gets cut first and the shortest of smaller lengths gets cut last. The exception to this rule is whenever a shorter length will not fit in what is left of the 5m length of aluminium extrusion, I use the longest shorter length that will fit.</p>

<p>This seems to produce a very efficient (very little off cut waste) cutting list and doesn't take long to calculate. I imagine, however, that even though the cutting list is <strong>very</strong> efficient, it is not necessarily the <strong>most</strong> efficient.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to calculate the most efficient cutting list which can be calculated in a reasonable amount of time?</p>

<p>What I'm really looking for is something like ""IsValidColumn"" so I can keep this 1 mapping function throughout my DataAccess class with all the left/right mappings defined - and have it work even when a sproc doesn't return every column listed ...</p>

<pre><code>Using reader As SqlDataReader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
  Dim product As Product
  While reader.Read()
    product = New Product()
    product.ID = Convert.ToInt32(reader(""ProductID""))
    product.SupplierID = Convert.ToInt32(reader(""SupplierID""))

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p>

<p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p>

<p>In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p>

<p>So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?</p>

In the debug window it says the program has exited with code 0.  If this function is named anything other than main(), the compiler complains saying 'blah' must return a value.  Sticking a <code>return;</code> also causes the error to appear.  But leaving it out completely, it compiles just fine.</p>

However, it is a fairly large function and I would like to narrow it down a little.  I know it's happening in a <code>memset()</code> call, but that particular function has about 35 of them, so I was hoping that by looking at the disassembly I could figure out where about the problem actually is.</p>

<p>I need to use push-technology with WCF through client firewalls. This must be a common problem, and I know for a fact it works in theory (see links below), but I have failed to get it working, and I haven't been able to find a code sample that demonstrates it.</p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>Clients connects to server through tcp port 80 (netTcpBinding).</li>
<li>Server pushes back information at irregular intervals (1 min to several hours).</li>
<li>Users should not have to configure their firewalls, server pushes must pass through firewalls that have all inbound ports closed. TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.</li>
<li>Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.</li>
<li>Server is IIS7 with WAS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding. Based on this information:</p>

<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2006/05/01/configuring-wcf-for-nats-and-firewalls.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WCF through firewalls and NATs</a></p>

I inadvertently used the MVC pattern even before I knew what it was, and still use it in my everyday job. From what I've seen, it's probably the most popular pattern used today. What I haven't heard much about though, are the alternative patterns you can use instead of MVC. What options are there, and for what reasons would you decide to use them over MVC? I'm also interested in knowing the types of systems they are typical of being used for. Finally, what are the pros and cons that come along with using them?</p>

The problem is that is usually doesn't happen unless the code is running for a couple days, so it's hard to catch it in the act.</p>

<p>I'm using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>char *msg = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*2048);
char *temp = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*1024);
memset(msg, 0, 2048);
memset(temp, 0, 1024);
char *tempstr = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char)*128);

sprintf(temp, ""%s %s/%s %s%s"", EZMPPOST, EZMPTAG, EZMPVER, TYPETXT, EOL);
strcat(msg, temp);

//Add Data
memset(tempstr, '\0', 128);
wcstombs(tempstr, gdevID, wcslen(gdevID));
sprintf(temp, ""%s: %s%s"", ""DeviceID"", tempstr, EOL);
strcat(msg, temp);

<p>As you can see, I'm not trying to use memset with a size larger that what's originally allocated with <code>malloc()</code></p>

<p>Anyone see what might be wrong with this?</p>

I'm getting a reduce/reduce conflict with the '-' operator, which can be used both for subtraction and negation. Here is a sample of the grammar I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>%token &lt;int&gt; INT
%token &lt;string&gt; ID
%token MINUS

%start expr
%type &lt;expr&gt; expr

%nonassoc INT ID
%left MINUS
%left APPLY

%%

expr: INT
    { ExprInt $1 }
| ID
    { ExprId $1 }
| expr MINUS expr
    { ExprSub($1, $3) }
| MINUS expr
    { ExprNeg $2 }
| expr expr %prec APPLY
    { ExprApply($1, $2) };
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when you get an expression like ""a - b"" the parser doesn't know whether this should be reduced as ""a (-b)"" (negation of b, followed by application) or ""a - b"" (subtraction). The subtraction reduction is correct. How do I resolve the conflict in favor of that rule?</p>

The syntax for parameter declarations was also changed to reflect the C++ style.</p>

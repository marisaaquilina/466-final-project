However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p><h2>Caching</h2><p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p><p>My question on this:</p><p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p><h2>Finally</h2><p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>"

I tried <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/Terminals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Terminals</a> a few times before, but quite often I need to see two or three sessions side by side which the tabbing doesn't really facilitate too well, would've been nice to have a 'pop out in own window' button. I did once grab the source code to fix stuff like that, but never got the time. I also found it behaved oddly whenever there was a brief network disconnect (e.g. xDSL flapping) and it would reconnect to the wrong session (usually a new one) and leave the session I had opened in a disconnected state on the server. Otherwise Terminals would've been really cool, we have 200+ windows servers, and organising all those .rdp files can be a pain.</p>"

I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li><li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a &quot;driver&quot; function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array.</li><li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li></ol><p>Thanks everyone for your imput.</p>"

The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p><p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p><p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p><p>Now here's the rub:<br>When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p><p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p><ol><li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li><li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li></ol><p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p><p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p><p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p><hr><p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p><p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p><hr><blockquote>  <ol start=""3"">  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>  </ol></blockquote><p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p><blockquote>  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p></blockquote><p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.

Now, I would like to update it so that the server can actually send a message to the client to request data.  As I currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server, this doesn't allow for the server to send a request at any time.  I would have to wait for client data.  My first thought would be to create another thread on the client with a separate open socket, listening for server requests...just like the server already has in respect the client.  Is there a way, within the same thread and using the same socket, to all the server to send requests at any time?</p><p>Can you use something to the effect of <code>WaitForMultipleObjects()</code> and pass it a receive buffer and an event that tells it there is data to be sent?</p>"

They can be opened in separate windows, or docked into tabs in the main window.</p><p>If I open a modal dialog from one of the separate forms, the main form is brought to the front, and is shown as the selected window in the windows taskbar. Say the main form is the WYSIWYG view, and the source view is poped out. You go to a particular point in the source view and insert an image tag. A dialog appears to allow you to select and enter the properties you want for the image. If the WYSIWYG view and the source view overlap, the WYSIWYG view will be brought to the front and the source view is hidden. Once the dialog is dismissed, the source view comes back into sight.</p><p>I've tried setting the owner and the ParentWindow properties to the form it is related to:</p><blockquote><code>dialog := TDialogForm.Create( parentForm );<br>  dialog.ParentWindow := parentForm.Handle;</code></blockquote><p>How can I fix this problem?

The files you have open are either in tabs (like in the Delphi IDE) or in its own window. Suppose the user brings up the spell check dialog or the find dialog. What happens, is that if the file is being editing in its own window, that window is sent to below the main form in the z-order when the modal dialog is shown; once the dialog is closed, it is returned to its original z-order.</p><p><b>Note</b>: If you are using Delphi 7 and looking for a solution to this problem, see my answer lower down on the page to see what I ended up doing.</p>"

Are there other restrictions I should be aware of while using one of these indexing algorithms?</p>"

For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p><p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p><p>Here's an example code snippet:</p><pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));bool success = false;while (!success){    try    {        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail        success = true;    }    catch (IOException e)    {        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)        {            throw e;        }        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();    }}</code></pre><p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p><pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()    {        // some code block    } );</code></pre><p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p><p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p><p>In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p><p>So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?</p>"

I have realised that the reason I'm asking so many questions may not be because I'm so new to Python (but I know a good bit of PHP) and is probably not because Python has some inherent flaw.</p><p>Thus I will now say what the project is and what my current idea is and you can either tell me I'm doing it all wrong, that there's a few things I need to learn or that Python is simply not suited to dealing with this type of project and language XYZ would be better in this instance or even that there's some open source project I might want to get involved in.</p><p><strong>The project</strong><br>I run a free turn based strategy game (think the campaign mode from the total war series but with even more complexity and depth) and am creating a combat simulator for it (again, think total war as an idea of how it'd work). I'm in no way deluded enough to think that I'll ever make anything as good as the Total war games alone but I do think that I can automate a process that I currently do by hand.</p><p><strong>What will it do</strong><br>It will have to take into account a large range of variables for the units, equipment, training, weather, terrain and so on and so forth. I'm aware it's a big task and I plan to do it a piece at a time in my free time. I've zero budget but it's a hobby that I'm prepared to put time into (and have already).</p><p><strong>My current stumbling block</strong><br>In PHP everything can access everything else, ""wrong"" though some might consider this it's really really handy for this. If I have an array of equipment for use by the units, I can get hold of that array from anywhere. With Python I have to remake that array each time I import the relevant data file and this seems quite a silly solution for a language that from my experience is well thought out. I've put in a system of logging function calls and class creation (because I know from a very basic version of this that I did in PHP once that it'll help a lot down the line) and the way that I've kept the data in one place is to pass each of my classes an instance to my logging list, smells like a hack to me but it's the only way I've gotten it to work.</p><p>Thus I conclude I'm missing something and would very much appreciate the insight of anybody willing to give it. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Code samples</strong></p><p>This creates a list of formations, so far there's only one value (besides the name) but I anticipate adding more on which is why they're a list of classes rather than just a standard list. This is found within data.py</p><pre><code>formations = []formationsHash = []def createFormations(logger):    """"""This creates all the formations that will be used""""""    # Standard close quarter formation, maximum number of people per square metre    formationsHash.append('Tight')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Tight', tightness = 1))    # Standard ranged combat formation, good people per square metre but not too cramped    formationsHash.append('Loose')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Loose', tightness = 0.5))    # Standard skirmishing formation, very good for moving around terrain and avoiding missile fire    formationsHash.append('Skirmish')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Skirmish', tightness = 0.1))    # Very unflexible but good for charges    formationsHash.append('Arrowhead')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Arrowhead', tightness = 1))def getFormation(searchFor):    """"""Returns the fomation object with this name""""""    indexValue = formationsHash.index(searchFor)    return formations[indexValue]</code></pre><p>I don't have a code sample of when I'd need to access it because I've not gotten as far as making it but I anticipate the code looking something like the following:</p><pre><code>PythontempFormation = data.getFormation(unit.formationType)tempTerrain = data.getTerrain(unit.currentTerrain)unit.attackDamage = unit.attackDamage * tempTerrain.tighnessBonus(tempFormation.tightness)</code></pre><p>The unit contains an integer that links to the index/key of the relevant terrain, formation and whatnot in the master list. Temporary variables are used to make the 3rd line shorter but in the long run will possibly cause issues if I forget to get one and it's use a value from earlier which is then incorrect (that's where the logging comes in handy). </p><pre><code>PHP$unit-&gt;attackDamage *= $terrain[$unit-&gt;currentTerrain]-&gt;tighnessBonus($unit-&gt;currentTerrain)</code></pre><p>The unit class contains the index (probably a string) of the relevant terrain it's on and the formation it's in.</p><p>Maybe this will show some massive flaw in my understanding of Python (6 months vs the 3 years of PHP).</p>"

What I have in mind is something like this:</p><pre><code>using System.IO;public abstract class ExternalApplicationBase{   protected ExternalApplicationBase()   {      InitializeFromConfiguration();   }   public string Path { get; protected set; }   public bool Exists()    {      if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.Path))         throw new ConfigurationException(""Path not specified."");      return File.Exists(this.Path);   }   public virtual void Execute(string args)   {      // Implementation to launch the application   }    protected abstract InitializeFromConfiguration();}public class App1 : ExternalApplicationBase{   protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration()   {      // Implementation to initialize this application from      // the application's configuration file.   } } public class App2 : ExternalApplicationBase {   protected virtual void InitializeFromConfiguration()   {      // Implementation to initialize this application from      // the application's configuration file.   } }</code></pre><p>My concerns are as follows:</p><ol><li><p>A class, interface, or other construct may already exist that does this, and I just haven't stumbled across it.</p></li><li><p>It may be overkill for what I want to do. Note, however, that the application uses at least three separate 3rd party applications that I have identified so far (and more are almost certain to pop up). </p></li><li><p>I'm not entirely comfortable with the name of the base class. It seems fuzzy, and not very informative (but I couldn't think of much better, given that Application is already well defined, reserved by the Framework, and would create a gross level of confusion were I to use it).</p></li><li><p>The idea is that I want to be able to keep the application configuration data (it's path and executable name) in the App.Config file, and check for its existence when my application starts up; when my software needs to launch the software, I want to do it through a single method call, and not have the code building command lines and trying to launch the software manually (as it currently does).</p></li></ol><p>So I'm sending out a request for help, guidance, and suggestions.

It could be a syntax error on my part, but the compiler isn't catching. Anyway, here is what I'm trying to do. Basically I've written my own repository class that essentially just wraps the Fluent Repository class. So here is the relevant code: </p><pre><code>Public Class GenericRepository(Of T As IHasIntId)     Private _fluentRepos As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository     Public Sub New(ByVal FluentRepository As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository)         _fluentRepos = FluentRepository     End Sub     Private Sub New()     End Sub     Public Function GetById(ByVal Id As Integer) As T         Return Query(Function(x As T) (x.Id = Id)).FirstOrDefault     End Function     Public Function Query(ByVal w As Expression(Of System.Func(Of T, Boolean))) As IList(Of T)         Return _fluentRepos.Query(Of T)(w).ToList()     End Function End Class </code></pre><p>Then I wrote two unit tests, one that would pass in an InMemoryRepository and one that would use an actual NHibernate session to hit the real database. here they are: </p><pre><code> &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub InMemoryTest()         Dim inmemRepos As New InMemoryRepository()         Dim p As New Product()         Dim id As Integer = 5         p.Id = id         p.Title = ""my product""         inmemRepos.Save(p)         Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(inmemRepos)         Dim foundP = genRepos.GetById(id)         Assert.AreEqual(p.Title, foundP.Title)     End Sub    &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub DatabaseTest()         Dim session = NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.GetSession()         Dim flRepos As New Repository(session)         Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(flRepos)         Dim id As Integer = 1         Dim p = genRepos.GetById(id)         Assert.IsNotNull(p)         Assert.AreEqual(id, p.Id)     End Sub </code></pre><p>The InMemoryTest passed, and the DatabaseTest failed. The exception from the DatabaseTest was a type conversion, from int to product (or maybe the other way around.) I was able to ""fix"" it though. In the Fluent NHibernate code I changed the Query method on the Repository class from: </p><pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where).ToArray(); </code></pre><p>to </p><pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where.Compile()).ToArray(); </code></pre><p>Now both tests pass.

We needed validation for the user input for dates, so I have implemented a combination of masking for format validation and parsing for actual date validation. I have done this using a custom CellEditor for the date column.</p><p>Inside my MaskedCellEditor, I have a JFormattedTextField. I setup the masking for dates. Then I add an InputVerifier to allow for actual validation. My InputVerifier implements verify() to check: 1. textField.isEditValid() 2. DateValidator.ValidDate(). If either is invalid, verify returns false and the InputVerifier locks the focus into the text field (the cell editor) and a small message dialog is displayed reminding the user of the date format.</p><p>The error message is a small, undecorated, non-modal, non-focusable JDialog that pops up underneath the cell being edited. It disappears on a keypress or a successful date verification. It is working great except for a small edge case.</p><p>If the user selects a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog, it switches screens, destroying everything currently on the screen (including the table). However, since the dialog is being shown and a keypress/successful edit has not occurred, the dialog is never hidden. It remains visible in a completely unrelated context on a different screen. Once the user has switched off the screen with the table, there is no way for the user to get rid of the dialog.</p><p>I have debated throwing either a Timer and/or a MouseListener on the dialog itself that would cause it to disappear, but I feel that I am ignoring the actual problem. The dialog is never being disposed of and I am pretty sure its because it is still set to be visible and it is preventing the garbage collector from getting rid of it.</p><p>I have a Cleanup method on the panel holding the JTable, but I cannot find a good way to reference the dialog (a component of the InputVerifier) in order to get rid of it. The dialog is pretty far removed from the table's parent panel. (Panel -> JTable -> CellEditor -> JFormattedTextField -> InputVerifier -> JDialog)</p><p>Any ideas on how to force the dialog to be hidden when the table is destroyed? If you need more details, let me know. I'm trying not to get you guys bogged down in the details, but there is a lot going on.</p>"

Yes, that's right, you have to implement the method to throw a NotImplementedException (unlike a pure virtual function call in C++ - now that makes sense!).  While that's pretty damn funny, there is a more serious problem in my mind.</p><p>I just wonder, in the presence of the NotImplementedException, how can anyone do anything with .Net?

Since calling it may have side effects, I can't do all my checks up-front and then run my algorithm.

So the question is:  <strong>Why does the NotImplementedException exist</strong>?</p><p>As a preemptive strike, I do not want anyone to respond with, ""because designers need to put this in the auto-generated code.""  This is horrid.  I would rather the auto-generated code not compile until you supply an implementation.

Have you ever left a NotImplementedException in your code?  If so, did this represent a time bomb (ie, you accidentally left it there), or a design flaw (the method should not be implemented and will never be called)?</p><p>I'm very suspicious of the NotSupportedException also...  Not supported?  What the?  If it's not supported, why is it part of your interface?  Can anyone at Microsoft spell improper inheritance?

I get indeterminate when I divide zero by zero. How do you check for infinite and indeterminate values in C++?</p><p>In C++, infinity is represented by 1.#INF. Indeterminate is represented by -1.#IND. The problem is how to test if a variable is infinite or indeterminate. Checking infinity is relatively straightforward: You find the infinity definition in your particular C++. For my case (VS2003), it is std::numeric_limits::infinity(). You have to include ""limits"" in order to use it. You can assign this infinite value to a variable and you can compare it to some value in order to check if that value is infinite.</p><p>Indeterminate is a little tricky, because you cannot compare an indeterminate value to some other value. Any comparison returns false. You can use this property to detect an indeterminate value by comparing it to itself. Let's say you have a double variable called aVal. Under normal conditions, aVal != aVal returns false. But if the value is indeterminate, aIndVal != aIndVal returns true. This weird situation is not present for infinite values, i.e. aInfVal != aInfVal always returns false.</p><p>Here are two functions that can be used to check for indeterminate and infinite values:</p><pre><code>#include ""limits.h""#include ""math.h""bool isIndeterminate(const double pV){    return (pV != pV);} bool isInfinite(const double pV){    return (fabs(pV) == std::numeric_limits::infinity())}</code></pre><p>Are there better ways for these checks, am I missing anything?</p>"

It is a custom class because we are not allowed to install additional software on our servers (nLog, log4net, etc).</p><p>I currently use it in two of my projects and have seen some good results from it.  Right now I am trapping the errors that cause page and application errors.  It sends and stores the error message and all inner exceptions.  </p><p>The problem I am having now is, I am receiving errors that I am not quite sure how to reproduce.  I have not heard any error reports from any of my users.  I am not sure what they are doing, or even if they are seeing these as errors.</p><p>I am thinking about creating an Event Log on each page, or the ones I want additional information on.  Keeping it as a Session variable on the page, and writing events to it (start/end of functions, variable changes, etc).  Then only if an error is called to have that send along with the error message to see if it gives a better picture of what is going on.  I am hoping that doing it this way will not give me tons of event logs when all users access the application, just want was going on right before the error happen with the one user.</p><p>Do you know of any pitfalls I should watchout with method?</p><p>Do you have any advise for things to look for?  </p><p>Update:</p><p>@Saret: I understnad where you are coming from with that response and I agree.  I am fairly new to this company and still need to learn how they do things.

The problem comes down to is, we work on secure systems and getting approval to get these things takes a lot of time, top cover, and dealing with all the red tape.  I will look into the situation further because I believe having a good error logging system in place is important, currently nothing is being used.</p><p>@Jim Blizard: I wanted to try to get away from logging/storing everything someplace to come back and find out what is important to the situation that caused the error.  I didn't want to fall into overload of information that is talked about in artical that Roberto Barros linked.  My current method of thinking is, keeping a string in memory on each page, and if an error is rasied, on the pages Page_Error event, grab that string and attach it to the exception that is getting logged.  That way I am only logging the error/exceptions that occured and storing the event log with that error.  If nothing happens, that log that was being created is dropped into the bit bucket never to be seen again.</p><p>@Roberto Barros:  Thanks for that link, I remember reading it somewhere but forgot to save it.</p>"

Since mixins can chain, I can mix-in all sorts of behaviour (and state) into one object.</p><p>If anyone wants clarification on the technique, please ask.  My question is, how can I get reuse like that in C#?  Note: C# generics don't allow inheriting from a generic parameter.</p>"

This app does NOT have an API I can use to feed data into.  I have heard of a guy who was able to actually push data onto the screen in this app's windows and controls programmatically, such that the data was able to be collected into, say, an Excel worksheet, then effectively uploaded into this app.  Sort of a reverse screen-scrape.  It's not pretty like an API would be, but it works.</p><p>I've seen app's interact with other apps in a similar way.  One good example I can think of is SnagIt, the screenshot utility.  You can order it to screen capture a window in a particular app, and as you move your mouse around that window, the controls under the pointer will outline in red to indicate which control it will capture for you.  I think that is interesting, and probably just a step away from actually being able to type text <em>into</em> such a control.</p><p>Thanks for the comments and answers so far, I'm pursuing them all.</p>"

Preferably something that doesn't base itself on JPA.</p><p>Our problem is that we are building a complex (as in, many objects refer to each other) stateful RIA system. It seems as Hibernate is designed to be used mainly on one-off applications - JSF and the like.</p><p>The problem is mainly that of lazy loading. Since there can be several HTTP requests between the initialization and actually loading lazy collections, a session per transaction is out of the question. A long-lived session (one per application) doesn't work well either, because once a transaction hits a snag and throws an exception, the whole session is invalidated, thus the lazy loaded objects break. Then there's all kinds of stuff that just don't work for us (like implicit data persisting of data from outside an initialized transaction).</p><p>My poor explanations aside, the bottom line is that Hibernate does magic we don't like. It seems like TopLink isn't any better, it also being written on top of EJB.</p><p>So, a stateless persistence layer (or even bright-enough object-oriented database abstraction layer) is what we would need the most.</p><p>Any thoughts, or am I asking for something that doesn't exist?</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm sorry for my ambiguous terminology, and thank you all for your corrections and insightful answers.

From usage expectations, not all callers are going to be interested in ""someOtherNumber"".</p><p>As a contrast, the only instances that I can think of right now within the .Net framework where ""out"" parameters make sense are in methods like TryParse().

All of my development work involves internal tools, mostly in Java, so nothing that is released to the public. Right now, I feel like my development workflow is very ""hobbyist"" and is nothing like you would see at an experienced software development firm. I would be inclined to say that it doesn't really matter since I'm the only developer anyway, but it can't hurt to make some changes, if for no other reason than to make my job a little easier and get a few more technologies on my resume. Right now my workflow is something like this:</p><ul><li><p>I do most of my development work in Eclipse on my laptop. Everything is saved locally on my laptop, and I don't use a VCS, nor do I really backup my code (except for occasionally emailing it to myself so I can see it on a different computer - yeah, I told you my development environment needs work). </p></li><li><p>When I'm done with a project and want to deploy it or if I just want to test it, I use the built-in Jar tool in Eclipse to make an executable .jar of my project. If I use external .jar libraries, I use the Fat-Jar plugin to include those .jars in my executable .jar. </p></li><li><p>After I create the .jar, I manually upload it to the server via SFTP and test it with something like <code>java -jar MyProject.jar</code>.</p></li></ul><p>Oh yeah, did I mention that I don't unit test? </p><p>The most glaringly obvious problem that I'd like to fix first is my lack of source control. I like git because of it's distributed nature, but it doesn't seem to integrate with Eclipse well and I've heard that it doesn't work very well on Windows, which is my primary development OS. So, I'm leaning toward SVN, which I do have some experience with. I do have my own personal server, and I think I'll use that for my source control, because I'd rather be my own admin than have to deal with university bureaucracy. I had some trouble setting up SVN once before, but I'll give it another shot. Maybe I'll also install something like Trac or Redmine for bug-tracking, todo list, etc?</p><p>What about building and deployment? There has to be a better way than using Fat-Jar and manually uploading my jar to the server. I've heard about tools like Ant and Maven - do these apply to what I want to do? How can I get started using those? </p><p>I suppose I'd eventually like to integrate unit testing with JUnit too. Even though it probably should be, that is not my primary concern right now, because so far my applications aren't terribly complex. I'd really like to work on simplifying and streamlining my workflow right now, and then I'll ease into unit testing. </p><p>Sorry for the long question. I guess my question boils down to, for a sole developer, what tools and methodologies can/should I be using to not only make my job easier, but also just to expose myself to some technologies that would be expected requisite knowledge at a dedicated development house?</p><hr><p>edit: Thanks for the great answers so far. I didn't mean to suggest that I wanted to make my workflow ""enterprisey"" just for the sake of doing it, but to make my job simpler and to get a few technologies under my belt that are typically used in enterprise development environments. That's all I meant by that.</p>"

The versions can live side-by-side.</p><p>Five years ago, we rewrote one of those versions in C#.Net. Two years later, another version (let's call it version M) was rewritten, and two years after that, it was time for the last remaining version (let's call it version C) to be converted.

For this, we use OpenNetCF's DateTimeHelper class, which seems to serve as a wrapper around Win32 P/Invokes.</p><p>One of the other features of the task manager is that if a task runs longer than its allotted time window, the task manager will Thread.Abort() it to allow other tasks to run. We're seeing an alarming number of thread abortions in which the highest function on the stack is OpenNetCF.WindowsCE.NativeMethods.SetTimeZoneInformation(). Why would the underlying P/Invoke (SetTimeZoneInfo) hang for such a long time?</p><p>Our code runs on Windows CE 4.2, and with a much smaller userbase, on Windows CE 5.0 -- the code here is the same between the two versions.

It could be a syntax error on my part, but the compiler isn't catching. Anyway, here is what I'm trying to do. Basically I've written my own repository class that essentially just wraps the Fluent Repository class. So here is the relevant code: </p><pre><code>Public Class GenericRepository(Of T As IHasIntId)     Private _fluentRepos As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository     Public Sub New(ByVal FluentRepository As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository)         _fluentRepos = FluentRepository     End Sub     Private Sub New()     End Sub     Public Function GetById(ByVal Id As Integer) As T         Return Query(Function(x As T) (x.Id = Id)).FirstOrDefault     End Function     Public Function Query(ByVal w As Expression(Of System.Func(Of T, Boolean))) As IList(Of T)         Return _fluentRepos.Query(Of T)(w).ToList()     End Function End Class </code></pre><p>Then I wrote two unit tests, one that would pass in an InMemoryRepository and one that would use an actual NHibernate session to hit the real database. here they are: </p><pre><code> &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub InMemoryTest()         Dim inmemRepos As New InMemoryRepository()         Dim p As New Product()         Dim id As Integer = 5         p.Id = id         p.Title = ""my product""         inmemRepos.Save(p)         Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(inmemRepos)         Dim foundP = genRepos.GetById(id)         Assert.AreEqual(p.Title, foundP.Title)     End Sub    &lt;TestMethod()&gt; Public Sub DatabaseTest()         Dim session = NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.GetSession()         Dim flRepos As New Repository(session)         Dim genRepos As New GenericRepository(Of Product)(flRepos)         Dim id As Integer = 1         Dim p = genRepos.GetById(id)         Assert.IsNotNull(p)         Assert.AreEqual(id, p.Id)     End Sub </code></pre><p>The InMemoryTest passed, and the DatabaseTest failed. The exception from the DatabaseTest was a type conversion, from int to product (or maybe the other way around.) I was able to ""fix"" it though. In the Fluent NHibernate code I changed the Query method on the Repository class from: </p><pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where).ToArray(); </code></pre><p>to </p><pre><code>return _session.Linq&lt;T&gt;().Where(where.Compile()).ToArray(); </code></pre><p>Now both tests pass.

The database is running on an HP Proliant ML370 G5 server with Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10; I am querying it from my laptop over a private network managed by a simple D-Link router. I assigned static DHCP (private) IPs to both laptop and server.</p><p>Anyway, from my laptop, using pgAdmin III, I send off some SQL commands/queries; some of these are CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, DELETE, SELECT, etc. Sometimes I send a command (like CREATE INDEX), it returns, telling me that the query was executed perfectly, etc. However, the postmaster process assigned to such a command seems to remain sleeping on the server. Now, I do not really mind this, for I say to myself that PostgreSQL maintains a pool of postmasters ready to process queries. Yet, if this process eats up 6 GB of it 9.4 GB assigned RAM, I worry (and it does so for the moment). Now maybe this is a cache of data that is kept in [shared] memory in case another query happens to need to use that same data, but I do not know.</p><p>Another thing is bothering me. </p><p>I have 2 tables. One is the <em>page</em> table; I have an index on its <em>page_id</em> column. The other is the <em>pagelinks</em> tables which has the <em>pl_from</em> column that references either nothing or a variable in the <em>page.page_id</em> column; unlike the <em>page_id</em> column, the <em>pl_from</em> has no index (yet). To give you an idea of the scale of the tables and the necessity for me to find a viable solution, <em>page</em> table has 13.4 million rows (after I deleted those I do not need) while the <em>pagelinks</em> table has 293 million.</p><p>I need to execute the following command to clean the <em>pagelinks</em> table of some of its useless rows:</p><pre><code>DELETE FROM pagelinks USING page WHERE pl_from NOT IN (page_id);</code></pre><p>So basically, I wish to rid the <em>pagelinks</em> table of all links coming from a page not in the <em>page</em> table. Even after disabling the nested loops and/or sequential scans, the query optimizer always gives me the following ""solution"":</p><pre><code>Nested Loop  (cost=494640.60..112115531252189.59 rows=3953377028232000 width=6)  Join Filter: (""outer"".pl_from &lt;&gt; ""inner"".page_id)""  -&gt;  Seq Scan on pagelinks  (cost=0.00..5889791.00 rows=293392800 width=17)  -&gt;  Materialize  (cost=494640.60..708341.51 rows=13474691 width=11)        -&gt;  Seq Scan on page  (cost=0.00..402211.91 rows=13474691 width=11)</code></pre><p>It seems that such a task would take more than weeks to complete; obviously, this is unacceptable. It seems to me that I would much rather it use the <em>page_id</em> index to do its thing...but it is a stubborn optimizer and I might be wrong. </p>"

I've read a number of articles that pretty much advocate against giving up an estimate because the client will budget for that number and even as requirements change, the number in their head and in the books doesn't.</p><p>I've read there are a number of ways to factor in pricing in the contract, but almost all of them (save one) incorporate an up-front number.

34235,416460,2,2,1/5/09,414388,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/414388/error-dialog-not-being-destroyed,Error Dialog Not Being Destroyed,"<p>I am working on a project that is using a JTable to display, among other things, a column of dates. We needed validation for the user input for dates, so I have implemented a combination of masking for format validation and parsing for actual date validation. I have done this using a custom CellEditor for the date column.</p><p>Inside my MaskedCellEditor, I have a JFormattedTextField. I setup the masking for dates. Then I add an InputVerifier to allow for actual validation. My InputVerifier implements verify() to check: 1. textField.isEditValid() 2. DateValidator.ValidDate(). If either is invalid, verify returns false and the InputVerifier locks the focus into the text field (the cell editor) and a small message dialog is displayed reminding the user of the date format.</p><p>The error message is a small, undecorated, non-modal, non-focusable JDialog that pops up underneath the cell being edited. It disappears on a keypress or a successful date verification. It is working great except for a small edge case.</p><p>If the user selects a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog, it switches screens, destroying everything currently on the screen (including the table). However, since the dialog is being shown and a keypress/successful edit has not occurred, the dialog is never hidden. It remains visible in a completely unrelated context on a different screen. Once the user has switched off the screen with the table, there is no way for the user to get rid of the dialog.</p><p>I have debated throwing either a Timer and/or a MouseListener on the dialog itself that would cause it to disappear, but I feel that I am ignoring the actual problem. The dialog is never being disposed of and I am pretty sure its because it is still set to be visible and it is preventing the garbage collector from getting rid of it.</p><p>I have a Cleanup method on the panel holding the JTable, but I cannot find a good way to reference the dialog (a component of the InputVerifier) in order to get rid of it. The dialog is pretty far removed from the table's parent panel. (Panel -> JTable -> CellEditor -> JFormattedTextField -> InputVerifier -> JDialog)</p><p>Any ideas on how to force the dialog to be hidden when the table is destroyed? If you need more details, let me know. I'm trying not to get you guys bogged down in the details, but there is a lot going on.</p>"

Or will I need to override the cherrypy.tools.process_request_body and roll my own decoder?</p><p>It seems like the builtin wsgi server with cherrypy handles this as part of the HTTP/1.1 spec, but I could not seem to find documentation in cherrypy in accessing this functionality.</p><hr><p>...to clarify</p><p>I'm using latest version 3.1.1 or so of Cherrypy.</p><p>Making a default form just involves making parameters in the upload function.</p><p>For the multipart/form-data, I've been calling curl -F param1=@file1.jpg -F param2=sometext -F param3=@file3.wav <a href=""http://destination:port/upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://destination:port/upload</a></p><p>In that example, I get:</p><pre><code>args = ['param1','param2','param3] kwargs = {'param1':CString&lt;&gt;, 'param2': 'sometext', 'param3':CString&lt;&gt;}</code></pre><p>When trying to submit the multipart/mixed, I tried looking at the request.body, but kept on getting None for that, regardless of setting the body processing.</p><p>The input we're getting is coming in as this:</p><pre><code>user-agent:UNTRUSTED/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1content-language:en-UScontent-length:565719mime-version:1.0content-type:multipart/mixed; boundary='newdivider'host:192.168.1.1:8180transfer-encoding:chunked--newdividerContent-type: text/xml&lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt;&lt;data&gt;&lt;Stuff&gt;....etc...etc...--newdividerContent-type: image/jpegContent-ID: file://localhost/root1/photos/Garden.jpgContent-transfer-encoding: binary&lt;binary data&gt;</code></pre><p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that the multipart/mixed is the problem that cherrypy is just giving me just the rfile. Our goal is to have cherrypy process the body into its parts with minimal processing on the receive side (ie, let cherrypy do its magic). If that requires us being tougher on the sending format to be a content-type that cherrypy likes, then so be it. What are the accepted formats? Is it only multipart/form-data?</p>"

Is this the best way of doing it?</p><p>For example: a UserVO will be wrapped by the generic as a Optimistic. When a change is made to the Optimistic, the change will be made to the modified copy stored in the Optimistic while the original also stored in the Optimistic will remain intact.

With finite (and severely stretched) resources, I also can't afford to add all the features and then remove the unused ones.</p><p><strong>How do you find out what will be useful to your users?</strong> If a survey is the only option, do you have to structure your questions in certain ways (eg: don't show a list of possible features, since that would be leading them on)?</p>"

This class manages the texture instances and caches them, so that subsequent calls for texture with the same name are served from the cache. There is no need to purge the cache immediately as the last user releases the texture. We can simply keep the texture cached in memory and when the device gets short on memory, we receive the low memory warning and can purge the cache. This is a better solution, because the caching stuff does not pollute the <code>Texture</code> class, we do not have to mess with <code>release</code> and there is even a higher chance for cache hits. The <code>TextureManager</code> can be abstracted into a <code>ResourceManager</code>, so that it can cache other data, not only textures.</p>"

This is somewhat annoying, especially if you have to code for several bug fixing and a development version in parallel. Is there a way around that?</p><p>CLARIFICATION: My question is about the many versions of every single pom.xml that you get over time in your source control system that differ only by the version number of the pom and / or the version number of the parent pom.

In the first release the version is 1.0 - which appears in every pom.xml. In the second release the version is 1.1 - which again appears in every pom.xml. So you have to change every pom.xml - this is annoying if you release as often as you should.</p><p>UPDATE: If you think this is important: not having to specify the parent version is already being considered.

And the changes were relativly small, so I can hope I haven't messed up anything. My plan was to find another solution, but seeing it works and works well, you know how it is, I went forward to other problems I had to deal with, and I'm sure if there's no bug in this I won't ever make it better.</p><p>The more general question appeared to me though - obviously some languages allow us to monkey-patch large chunks of code inside classes. If this is the code I only use for myself, or the change is small, it's ok. What if some other developer takes my code though, he sees that I use some well-known module, so he can assume it works as it's used to. Then, this method suddenly behaves diffrent then it should. </p><p>So, very subjective, should we use monkey patching, and if yes, when and how? How should we document it? </p><hr><p>edit: for @guerda:</p><p>Monkey-patching is the ability to dynamicly change the behavior of some piece of code at the execution time, without altering the code itself.</p><p>A small example in Python:</p><pre><code>import osdef ld(name):    print(""The directory won't be listed here, it's a feature!"")os.listdir = ld# now what happens if we call os.listdir(""/home/"")?os.listdir(""/home/"")</code></pre>"

The number of clusters is not known. But you know the dimensions of the bitmap. Sometimes several points within a cluster has more mass than the center of the next (in size) cluster.

The data set is time stamped data values with a named primary key. e.g.</p><pre><code>Name: A|B|C:DValue: 124TimeStamp: 01/06/2009 08:24:39,223</code></pre><p>Could be a stock price at a given point in time, so it is, I suppose, a classic time series data pattern. However, I really need a generic RDBMS solution which will work with any reasonable JDBC compatible database as I would like to use Hibernate. Consequently, time series extensions to databases like Oracle are not really an option as I would like the implementor to be able to use their own JDBC/Hibernate capable database.</p><p>The challenge here is simply the massive volume of data that can accumulate in a short period of time. So far, my implementations are focused around defining periodical rollup and purge schedules where raw data is aggregated into DAY, WEEK, MONTH etc. tables, but the downside is the early loss of granularity and the slight inconvenience of period mismatches between periods stored in different aggregates.</p><p>The challenge has limited options since there is an absolute limit to how much data can be physically compressed while retaining the original granularity of the data, and this limit is exacerbated by the directive of using a relational database, and a generic JDBC capable one at that. </p><p>Borrowing a notional concept from classic data compression algorithms, and leveraging the fact that many consecutive values for the same named key can expected to be identical, I am wondering if there is way I can seamlessly reduce the number of stored records by  conflating repeating values into one logical row while also storing a counter that indicates, effectively, ""the next <strong>n</strong> records have the same value"". The implementation of just that seems simple enough, but the trade off is that the data model is now hideously complicated to query against using standard SQL, especially when using any sort of aggregate SQL functions. This significantly reduces the usefulness of the data store since only complex custom code can restore the data back to a ""decompressed"" state resulting in an impedance mismatch with hundreds of tools that will not be able to render this data properly.</p><p>I considered the possibility of defining custom Hibernate types that would basically ""understand"" the compressed data set and blow it back up and return query results with the dynamically created synthetic rows. (The database will be read only to all clients except the tightly controlled input stream). Several of the tools I had in mind will integrate with Hibernate/POJOS in addition to raw JDBC  (eg. JasperReports) But this does not really address the aggregate functions issue and probably has a bunch of other issues as well.</p><p>So I am part way to resigning myself to possibly having to use a more proprietary [possibly non-SQL] data store (any suggestions appreciated) and then focus on the possibly less complex task of writing a pseudo JDBC driver to at least ease integration with external tools. </p><p>I heard reference to something called a ""<em>bit packed file</em>"" as a mechanism to achieve this data compression, but I do not know of any databases that supply this and the last thing I want to do (or can do, really....) is write my own database.</p><p>Any suggestions or insight ?</p>"

When I trace the error to a specific line of code and comment out that line or replace it with different code to the same effect (e.g. by copying code that would otherwise be called via a function directly to the calling site), the error will appear to go away - typically only to reoccur a couple of (equally inconspicuous looking) statements later.</p><p>When running this inside the Delphi debugger I can see that the freezes are often preceded by Access Violations in <code>GetMem.inc</code> . At least all of these issues are 100% reproducible...</p><p>Needless to say we had none of these issues when compiling these addins in Delphi 2007.</p><p>Now, I'm quite at a loss. I know I have just been lucky but even though I consider myself a fairly experienced programmer (though mostly in niche areas) I never really had to deal with this class of error before. As the title of this question says, I don't even really know where to start. I can step through the code as much as I like but the endless assembler statements mean nothing to me and neither am I proficient in effectively using the CPU view.</p><p>Furthermore, I don't even know for sure yet whether this is an issue with my own code to begin with (I actually tend to doubt it in this case). We are makign massive use of a number of third-party libraries (e.g. JCL, ADX, Redemption). ADX in particular still labels its Delphi 2009 support ""beta"".</p><p>I also tried using FastMM's FullDebugMode and indeed I did uncover a number of errors in ADX that way (e.g. blocks that were modified after having been freed) but all of these also occur when I compile with Delphi 2007 so it doesn't yet seem imperative that these are ultimately the cause for the observed regression.</p><p>So, how do I deal with this? - or better yet: Where can I find some good resources on learning how to deal with this? e.g. tutorials on using the CPU view or effectively interpreting and acting upon the reports put out by FastMM? Are these the correct tools at all? Where else should I look?</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong><br>What types of code should I be suspicious of in this context? What kind of code even has the potential to wreak such havoc in memory? The only places I can think of where my code performs anything remotely approaching explicit memory manipulation is when reserving some buffer space in preparation of a WinAPI call. Also keep in mind that all of my code is identical between the Delphi 2007 and Delphi 2009 versions and the Delphi 2007 version exhibits no such problems.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong><br>With some probability the issue that prompted me to post this question has now been solved.

Ideally, just the letters would get squished or made thinner, leaving the space between words more or less the same. I know there are some CSS attributes that do things like this, but they are more focused on spacing between the letters and not so much on the widths of the letters themselves. These CSS methods are also not very cross-browser friendly. The majority of the user base is using IE6, so that puts a large restriction on CSS-based methods out of the blocks.</p><p>So, is there any way to control the character width/spacing that is cross-browser friendly?

In Hibernate, I would use the following 2 objects to represent this relationship in a (semi-)typesafe way:</p><pre><code>class User {    String username;    String passwd;    UserType type;}class UserType {    private enum Type {ADMIN, NORMAL};    private String type;    //Setters/Getters for Hibernate    public void setType(String type);    public String getType();    //Setters/Getters for user    public void setUserType(UserType.Type t);    public UserType.Type getUserType();    public static UserType fromType(UserType.Type t);}</code></pre><p>This works, but I find the UserType class ungly and requiring too much bureaucracy just to store a couple of values.

If not, is my pattern for representing enumerations good enough or am I missing something? What other patterns do people use? </p>"

Is there any way to always get the same instance over and over?</p><p>Anyone have any ideas why it was designed this way?</p><p>The reason I care at all is because I made a custom attribute that internally holds some validation information, so in the Attribute I basically have a ""private bool Validated"" that I set to true. The validation stuff takes a while, so I don't want to run it every time. Now the problem is that since it creates a new instance of the attribute each time I get the attributes, Validated is always ""false"".</p>"

In order to better support clients and our field technicians we also developed a web site to provide access to the service records in Clearview and reporting.  Over time our need to customize the behavior and add new features led to more and more things being tied to this website and it's database.</p><p>At this point we're dealing with things like a Company being defined partly in the Clearview database and partly in the website database.

This project is projected at 4-6 years.</p><p>We are at the very early stages of the preliminary design right now. I am seeing a LOT of information from Microsoft on VS 2010.  Is there something wrong with 2005/2008 that we should be concerned about? Or, is this SOP for MS to start pushing future products this early?  Is it worth waiting for 2010 to start any coding?  The functional design probably won't be finished by year end (2009) anyway and we can always do mock ups in VS-2005.</p><p>Secondly, FoxPro and VB6 are in the same boat; unsupported but alive for now.  Is moving to .NET smart? VB? C#? Will there come a time when MS decides that moving to VS 20xx requires another complete rewrite of old code (VB6)?  Or might they eliminate VB.net or C#.net for the next 'great' thing (foxpro)?  Or what about the lifespan of the .NET framework?

I tried something like:</p><pre><code>if(isset($v) || @is_null($v))</code></pre><p>(the <code>@</code> is necessary to avoid the warning when <code>$v</code> is not set) but <code>is_null()</code> has a similar problem to <code>isset()</code>: it returns <code>TRUE</code> on unset variables!

An array being turned into the data of an SQL <code>UPDATE</code> statement, where the array's keys are the table's columns, and the array's values are the values to be applied to each column.  Any of the table's columns can hold a <code>NULL</code> value, signified by passing a <code>NULL</code> value in the array.  You <em>need</em> a way to differentiate between an array key not existing, and an array's value being set to <code>NULL</code>; that's the difference between not updating the column's value and updating the column's value to <code>NULL</code>.</p><p>Second, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/418066/best-way-to-test-for-a-variables-existence-in-php-isset-is-clearly-broken#418162"">Zoredache's answer</a>, <code>array_key_exists()</code> works correctly, for my above use case and for any global variables:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php$a = NULL;var_dump(array_key_exists('a', $GLOBALS));var_dump(array_key_exists('b', $GLOBALS));</code></pre><p>outputs:</p><pre><code>bool(true)bool(false)</code></pre><p>Since that properly handles just about everywhere I can see there being any ambiguity between variables that don't exist and variables that are set to <code>NULL</code>, <strong>I'm calling <code>array_key_exists()</code> the official easiest way in PHP to truly check for the existence of a variable</strong>.</p><p>(Only other case I can think of is for class properties, for which there's <code>property_exists()</code>, which, according to <a href=""http://php.net/property_exists"" rel=""noreferrer"">its docs</a>, works similarly to <code>array_key_exists()</code> in that it properly distinguishes between not being set and being set to <code>NULL</code>.)</p>"

The office has high staff turnover, so training suffers, and so one of the self imposed requirements for this project is comprehensive, friendly documentation. However, to supplement this, and to save newbies having to open up a 100 page document when they want to try something new, I want a status bar on every userform (there are five) that provides contextual help. I find tooltips annoying.</p><p>I don't have a lot of experience, so I was wanting to</p><p>Essentially, I have a file containing every status string. (This is currently a text file, but I was wondering if I should use a spreadsheet or csv for ease of editing by other staff in future.) Every control has a MouseMove event which refers to a function: getStatus(cID) that opens the file, grabs the line and displays it in the status label. It also grabs a few parameters from the same line in the file, such as whether the label is clickable (to link to a page in the help file), and what colour the label should be.</p><p>So a few questions really:</p><p>Will the application be slow if a userform is constantly referring to a file? It feels fine to me, but I've been in it far too long, and I'm the only user accessing that file. There will be 80 constantly accessing it.</p><p>Is MouseMove over a control the best way? Should I instead use co-ordinates?</p><p>Most importantly (in terms of me having to do as little work as possible) is there some way to do this so that I do not have to have a MouseMove event on every single control? I have a good few hundred or so controls, each with their own identifier (well, not yet, but they will if this is the only way to do it). Maybe when the form loads I could load ALL the possible status lines so they're ready for whenever the control is moused over. But then, maybe the loading time is negligible?</p><p>Appreciate any ideas or thoughts - especially if VBA already has a whole range of functions to do this already and I'm just trying to reinvent the wheel.

So I did something like this:</p><pre><code>    public static String FormatAdvanced(this String stringToFormat, Object source)    {        Dictionary&lt;String, PropertyInfo&gt; info;        Type test;         String typeName;        //        currentType = source.GetType();        typeName = currentType.Name;        //        //info list is a static list for the class holding this method        if (infoList == null)        {            infoList = new Dictionary&lt;String, Dictionary&lt;String, PropertyInfo&gt;&gt;();        }        //        if (infoList.ContainsKey(typeName))        {            info = infoList[typeName];        }        else        {            info = test.GetProperties()                       .ToDictionary(item =&gt; item.Name);            infoList.Add(typeName, info);        }          //        foreach (var propertyInfoPair in info)        {            String currentKey;            String replacement;            replacement = propertyInfoPair.Value.GetValue(source, null).ToString();            currentKey = propertyInfoPair.Key;            if (stringToFormat.Contains(""{"" + currentKey + ""}""))            {                stringToFormat = stringToFormat                                 .Replace(""{"" + currentKey + ""}"", replacement);            }        }          //        return stringToFormat;    }</code></pre><p>Now in testing, it seems to keep the name it created for the anonymous type so that the second time through it doesn't get the property info off the type but off the dictionary. </p><p>If multiple people are hitting this method at the same time, is it pretty much going to work in a Session like fassion;  IE the names of the types will be specific to each instance of the program?  Or would it be even worse than that?  At what point does that name get chucked and overwritten?</p>"

Can anyone point me in the right direction? </p>"

Anyway, I have what I think should be an easy problem to solve:</p><p>I have a pop-up menu consisting of a list of radio buttons, and when I click one of them I want some action to occur.  The code goes like this:</p><pre><code>    Gtk::RadioMenuItem::Group group;    for ( size_t i = 1; i &lt; LH_MAX; ++i )    {        Gtk::RadioMenuItem* pItem = new Gtk::RadioMenuItem( group, names[i], names[i] );        pItem-&gt;set_name( names[i] );        pItem-&gt;signal_activate().connect( sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;MyClass::on_item_activated) );        pItem-&gt;show();        m_Menu.append( *Gtk::manage(pItem) );    }</code></pre><p>The only problem I see is that <code>MyClass::on_item_activated</code> gets called twice when a previously-unselected radio button is chosen from the menu.  It's called only once when the already-selected radio button is clicked.</p><p>I'm guessing that the first firing is to say ""something is no longer activate,"" and the second is for the new radio button activation.  Whether I'm right or wrong, the question is the same: how best can I have my handler only take action once per click?  Either I need the handler to get called only once, or I need something to check from inside it to know if the callback is a ""duplicate"" or not.</p>"

I am using the following structure:</p><pre><code>Application::AddMessageFilter(someFilter);while(someFilter-&gt;HasUserSelectedAPoint_Or_HitEscapeKey()){    Application::DoEvents();}Application::RemoveMessageFilter(someFilter);</code></pre><p>This works quite nicely except for taking up nearly 100% CPU usage when control enters the while loop. I am looking for an alternative similar to what is shown below:</p><pre><code>Application::AddMessageFilter(someFilter);while(someFilter-&gt;HasUserSelectedAPoint_Or_HitEscapeKey()){    // Assuming that ManagedGetMessage() below is a blocking    // call which yields control to the OS    if(ManagedGetMessage())        Application::DoEvents();}Application::RemoveMessageFilter(someFilter);</code></pre><p>What is the right way to use <code>IMessageFilter</code> and <code>DoEvents</code>? How do I surrender control to the OS till a message is received? Any <code>GetMessage</code> equivalent in the managed world?</p>"

Consider the two cases of not changing it when layout has it should have been changed and changing it when it should not have. </p><p>Not changing when it should have been changed occurs almost only when it is explicit. In this case, it results in some very subtle, hard-to-find bugs. Especially during development, when class layout changes often. But if it has not been explicitly specified, it will change and the deserialization will break loudly, mostly likely solved by purging the repository.</p><p>Changing it when should not have would occur almost only when it is implicit. This is the rare case where class layout has changed but we still want to deserialize from the old serialized blobs. This will likely be caught during QA (<em>Strange errors after upgrade from 5.2 to 5.2.1, see attached stack trace</em>) and can be trivially fixed by setting a explicit value. </p><p>Comments?</p>"

Having assembled my own PCs since i was a school kid, I viewed the activity of obtaining second-hand components to build a new PC as an easy task. It was straightforward to prepare a PC that would act as a dedicated Windows 2003 server for my development tests. But for over three years now, I have been <a href=""http://icelava.net/mycomputers.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">operating on real servers</a>, albeit low-end models. I ended up in this state due to a number of factors.</p><ol><li><strong>Stability</strong>. Server hardware built to work properly together. Tested to run server operating systems. Hardware that I assemble together may or may not work due to all those funny instances of unexpected incompatibilities. And unfortunately I ran into those situations more often than I should, like having to figure out why the PC won't boot up because I have the RAM modules plugged in a particular order, or by simple use of a particular DVD drive. I have not seen a single BSOD for my servers.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>. I leave my servers running 24x7 and for years have (thankfully) not experienced any failure in server hardware. In contrast my PCs are just cursed with rapid failure rates. Even my vendor-purchased laptops eventually sport funny problems one way or another (especially with power supply units).</li><li><strong>Warranty</strong>. I may have warranty for individual PC parts, but the warranty for the computer as a whole is against <em>myself</em>. If something were to fail, I myself was the person to call up for help. And call myself I did several times. With the server however, I call techsupport and get them to replace parts.</li><li><strong>Capacity</strong>. Virtualization is truly a wonderful thing. Makes setting up single-purpose machines so much easier to manage. I directly loaded my first server to the max with 4GB RAM and happily ran a variety of virtual machines, simulating the multi-server/workstation environments I needed. Now my new server has capacity for 24GB RAM to afford the bigger scenarios I am looking to experiment with (e.g. AD domains, BizTalk server group, TFS group, etc).</li></ol><p>All in all, with cranky DIYs I spent more time troubleshooting hardware problems than working on actual development issues. When I threw in the money to purchase real servers there was an instant drop in hardware problems in my life. I would probably have bought a vendor-built workstation too if only I could find a configuration that suited my development needs.</p><p>Now, some of my tech friends who are passionate with their work also operate their own servers at home. The thing is, most other folks/colleagues get rather surprised that I would actually spend cash for this category of machines. Some would classify me as insane. Have I truly gone overboard?</p><p><strong>UPDATE - Clarification on server usage</strong></p><p>The base server (Windows Server 2008) serves basic IIS 7/ASP.NET, SQL Server 2008, and Subversion services. But the largest role it plays is <strong>hosting a variety of virtual machines in Hyper-V</strong>. I am not a developer who is merely told to whack out application code against a single database and check it into some version control repository then go home without worrying how the application and implementation works out in a production environment. As a solutions integrator, I have to get an understanding of the client/customer environment and think of the big-picture solution that includes <em>infrastructure and deployment concerns</em>. Software application development, while being my primary role, is but a part of the solution.</p><p>I frequently find myself having to experiment and discover if certain suggestions or approaches would work for a given environment, and have had to prepare virtual servers like a forest of domains (controllers), web servers, database servers, BizTalk server groups, Team Foundation server, etc to conduct my analysis and solidify my recommendations. These virtual machines work as my personal POCs. The scenarios I face continue to grow larger, and I definitely do not see how I can get to learn how to handle these situations without a base platform that allows me to virtualise and simulate them.</p>"

One reason given for not static-importing was it was confusing where the method was defined, it wasn't in the current class and not in any superclass so it too some time to identify its definition (the web based review system does not have clickable links like IDE :-) I don't really think this matters, static-imports are still quite new and soon we will all get used to locating them.</p><p>But the other reason, the one I agree with, is that an unqualified method call seems to belong to current object and should not jump contexts.

It's my understanding that the primary use is to hamper a rainbow table attack.  However, the methods I've seen to implement this don't seem to really make the problem harder.</p><p>I've seen many tutorials suggesting that the salt be used as the following:</p><pre><code>$hash =  md5($salt.$password)</code></pre><p>The reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password, but a combination of the password and the salt.  But say <code>$salt=foo</code> and <code>$password=bar</code> and <code>$hash=3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f</code>.  Now somebody with a rainbow table could reverse the hash and come up with the input ""foobar"".  They could then try all combinations of passwords (f, fo, foo, ... oobar, obar, bar, ar, ar).  It might take a few more milliseconds to get the password, but not much else.</p><p>The other use I've seen is on my linux system.  In the /etc/shadow the hashed passwords are actually stored <em>with</em> the salt.  For example, a salt of ""foo"" and password of ""bar"" would hash to this: <code>$1$foo$te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX1</code>.  If a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file, I don't see what purpose the salt serves, since the reverse hash of <code>te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX</code> is known to contain ""foo"".</p><p>Thanks for any light anybody can shed on this.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Thanks for the help.  To summarize what I understand, the salt makes the hashed password more complex, thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table.  What I misunderstood before was that I was assuming a rainbow table existed for ALL hashes.</p>"

From there I create a new instance of its Type with Activator.</p><p>Now If I pass that created instance to a function that takes a generic parameter, the generic Type always comes across as Object, because Activator.CreateInstance() returns an Object, so ""var x"" is an Object, not, in this case, an ArrayList.</p><p>What I need to happen is for the generic type to be the actual type, int his case ""ArrayList"".</p><p>I know there is an Activator.CreateInstance() that I can use instead, but I can't use a Type (PropertyInfo.PropertyType) within the angle brackets for that method.</p><p>I could also just cast the returned object, like:</p><pre><code>myPropType x = (myPropType)Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);</code></pre><p>But obviously that doesn't compile... Plus it wouldn't be valid anyway because the cast is compile time, and I don't know the type until runtime, but conceptually its what I need...</p><p>So I'm stuck with this Type, but I can't figure out how to get it passed over to the WhatAmI() method, and have T be ArrayList, not Object.</p><p>Ideas?</p>"

It's a bit like an Enterprise Bus, but it does a little more.</p><p>We decided to use Windows Workflow to handle the requests. As soon as we figure out what kind of action is requested, we'll start a workflow that is specifically designed to handled the action.Now, some of the web services we'll call are asynchronous, so the workflow should wait for an answer.The basic idea is that we'll implement the callback web service on our end and when the callback arrives 'somehow' give it's data to the running workflow that's waiting on the answer.</p><p>So far I've seen two possibilities:</p><ol><li>the ExternalDataExchangeService</li><li>the WorkflowQueuingService</li></ol><p>The first service is relatively easy to use, but is event based, so if you miss the event, you miss the data.

And creating the queue seems only to be possible in the Execute override of an Activity.Since we have a lot of different workflows, we have a base workflow class that does some work in it's Initialize override and would very much like to do the queue creation in there, so we won't have to create a special ""Initialize"" activity that every workflow should start with. We would also like to have the notification for when a new item is received to be in the base-class. So the specific workflow would only have to wait on an WaitHandle to know there is data on the queue.Finally we want to be able to read the data from the queue from a Code Activity on the specific workflow (after the WaitHandle is signalled).</p><p>Does anyone have an idea, doesn't have to be with the two services I mentioned, but we would really like to keep things as simple as possible.</p>"

Whenever I try to hook to the events, VB environment (where I am trying to sink the events) crashes, so does the VBA environment which the third-party product (ESRI ArcMap) uses.</p><p>I have been able to (partially) implement <strong>IConnectionPointContainer</strong> interface (which COM uses in the background to handle events) manually, then I am able to sink the event and step into my IConnectionPointContainer implementation. However, this seems like an overkill to me and I think that there must an implicit support for this in .NET. Second, with this approach I instantly lose the delegate support.</p><p>Does anyone have any experience with this?Thanks in advance.</p>"

I tried making it multi-threaded (using ThreadPool.QueueWorkItem) where the SmsMessage was passed along.   However, I noticed that when I did that, the program would only handle the first sms event - afterwards, NO SMS were received by the device at all!   But when the program exits, then all the missed SMSs arrived.</p><p>Based on that, I'd guess that the answer to my question is that SmsMessage objects are NOT thread-safe, even though there's not really an indication that that's the case.</p><p>So what if we want to try and thread an SmsMessage Object?   I'll try that out tonight by making a copy of the SmsMessage (probably by using the constructor w/ item id), or I'll create an empty one and copy the fields manually.</p><p>DISCOVERY:</p><p>I narrowed down my problem.   I was able to get everything to work in a background thread when I copied the SmsMessage into my own object, taking care not to reference any of the SmsMessage's objects.   SMSs went flying through with no problem.</p><p>However, when I set up an MessageIntercepter to launch an application, and within that application instance, use a background thread to send an SMS, the application would work fine, but after it exits my code it crashes and displays the ""There was an error in yourapp.exe"" and asks me if you want to send the crash data to MS.   I could never figure out what that error was, but I found out that if I sent the SMS from the same thread that launched the application, everything worked fine.</p><p>So, threading when the app is open = fine, as long as you don't pass/use the SmsMessageThreading when the app is externally launched = fine, as long as you don't send an SmsMessage in another thread.</p>"

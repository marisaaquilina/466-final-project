However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p><h2>Caching</h2><p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p><p>My question on this:</p><p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p><h2>Finally</h2><p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>"

I tried <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/Terminals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Terminals</a> a few times before, but quite often I need to see two or three sessions side by side which the tabbing doesn't really facilitate too well, would've been nice to have a 'pop out in own window' button. I did once grab the source code to fix stuff like that, but never got the time. I also found it behaved oddly whenever there was a brief network disconnect (e.g. xDSL flapping) and it would reconnect to the wrong session (usually a new one) and leave the session I had opened in a disconnected state on the server. Otherwise Terminals would've been really cool, we have 200+ windows servers, and organising all those .rdp files can be a pain.</p>"

I want to get better at my hobby, which is all it is, as I am in high school.  Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li><li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a &quot;driver&quot; function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array.</li><li>The structure is a hypercube, and the number of dimensions is specified at run time, as well as the length of each dimension (which are all the same, as it is a hypercube).</li></ol><p>Thanks everyone for your imput.</p>"

The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p><p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p><p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p><p>Now here's the rub:<br>When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p><p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p><ol><li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li><li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li></ol><p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p><p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p><p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p><hr><p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p><p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p><hr><blockquote>  <ol start=""3"">  <li>Reproduce the problem. <code>Dr Watson</code> will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </li>  </ol></blockquote><p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p><blockquote>  <p>Another try might be using <code>WinDebug</code> as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight.</p></blockquote><p>Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong.

Now, I would like to update it so that the server can actually send a message to the client to request data.  As I currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server, this doesn't allow for the server to send a request at any time.  I would have to wait for client data.  My first thought would be to create another thread on the client with a separate open socket, listening for server requests...just like the server already has in respect the client.  Is there a way, within the same thread and using the same socket, to all the server to send requests at any time?</p><p>Can you use something to the effect of <code>WaitForMultipleObjects()</code> and pass it a receive buffer and an event that tells it there is data to be sent?</p>"

They can be opened in separate windows, or docked into tabs in the main window.</p><p>If I open a modal dialog from one of the separate forms, the main form is brought to the front, and is shown as the selected window in the windows taskbar. Say the main form is the WYSIWYG view, and the source view is poped out. You go to a particular point in the source view and insert an image tag. A dialog appears to allow you to select and enter the properties you want for the image. If the WYSIWYG view and the source view overlap, the WYSIWYG view will be brought to the front and the source view is hidden. Once the dialog is dismissed, the source view comes back into sight.</p><p>I've tried setting the owner and the ParentWindow properties to the form it is related to:</p><blockquote><code>dialog := TDialogForm.Create( parentForm );<br>  dialog.ParentWindow := parentForm.Handle;</code></blockquote><p>How can I fix this problem?

The files you have open are either in tabs (like in the Delphi IDE) or in its own window. Suppose the user brings up the spell check dialog or the find dialog. What happens, is that if the file is being editing in its own window, that window is sent to below the main form in the z-order when the modal dialog is shown; once the dialog is closed, it is returned to its original z-order.</p><p><b>Note</b>: If you are using Delphi 7 and looking for a solution to this problem, see my answer lower down on the page to see what I ended up doing.</p>"

Are there other restrictions I should be aware of while using one of these indexing algorithms?</p>"

For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p><p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p><p>Here's an example code snippet:</p><pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));bool success = false;while (!success){    try    {        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail        success = true;    }    catch (IOException e)    {        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)        {            throw e;        }        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();    }}</code></pre><p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p><pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()    {        // some code block    } );</code></pre><p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p><p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p><p>In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p><p>So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?</p>"

I have realised that the reason I'm asking so many questions may not be because I'm so new to Python (but I know a good bit of PHP) and is probably not because Python has some inherent flaw.</p><p>Thus I will now say what the project is and what my current idea is and you can either tell me I'm doing it all wrong, that there's a few things I need to learn or that Python is simply not suited to dealing with this type of project and language XYZ would be better in this instance or even that there's some open source project I might want to get involved in.</p><p><strong>The project</strong><br>I run a free turn based strategy game (think the campaign mode from the total war series but with even more complexity and depth) and am creating a combat simulator for it (again, think total war as an idea of how it'd work). I'm in no way deluded enough to think that I'll ever make anything as good as the Total war games alone but I do think that I can automate a process that I currently do by hand.</p><p><strong>What will it do</strong><br>It will have to take into account a large range of variables for the units, equipment, training, weather, terrain and so on and so forth. I'm aware it's a big task and I plan to do it a piece at a time in my free time. I've zero budget but it's a hobby that I'm prepared to put time into (and have already).</p><p><strong>My current stumbling block</strong><br>In PHP everything can access everything else, ""wrong"" though some might consider this it's really really handy for this. If I have an array of equipment for use by the units, I can get hold of that array from anywhere. With Python I have to remake that array each time I import the relevant data file and this seems quite a silly solution for a language that from my experience is well thought out. I've put in a system of logging function calls and class creation (because I know from a very basic version of this that I did in PHP once that it'll help a lot down the line) and the way that I've kept the data in one place is to pass each of my classes an instance to my logging list, smells like a hack to me but it's the only way I've gotten it to work.</p><p>Thus I conclude I'm missing something and would very much appreciate the insight of anybody willing to give it. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Code samples</strong></p><p>This creates a list of formations, so far there's only one value (besides the name) but I anticipate adding more on which is why they're a list of classes rather than just a standard list. This is found within data.py</p><pre><code>formations = []formationsHash = []def createFormations(logger):    """"""This creates all the formations that will be used""""""    # Standard close quarter formation, maximum number of people per square metre    formationsHash.append('Tight')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Tight', tightness = 1))    # Standard ranged combat formation, good people per square metre but not too cramped    formationsHash.append('Loose')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Loose', tightness = 0.5))    # Standard skirmishing formation, very good for moving around terrain and avoiding missile fire    formationsHash.append('Skirmish')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Skirmish', tightness = 0.1))    # Very unflexible but good for charges    formationsHash.append('Arrowhead')    formations.append(Formation(logger, 'Arrowhead', tightness = 1))def getFormation(searchFor):    """"""Returns the fomation object with this name""""""    indexValue = formationsHash.index(searchFor)    return formations[indexValue]</code></pre><p>I don't have a code sample of when I'd need to access it because I've not gotten as far as making it but I anticipate the code looking something like the following:</p><pre><code>PythontempFormation = data.getFormation(unit.formationType)tempTerrain = data.getTerrain(unit.currentTerrain)unit.attackDamage = unit.attackDamage * tempTerrain.tighnessBonus(tempFormation.tightness)</code></pre><p>The unit contains an integer that links to the index/key of the relevant terrain, formation and whatnot in the master list. Temporary variables are used to make the 3rd line shorter but in the long run will possibly cause issues if I forget to get one and it's use a value from earlier which is then incorrect (that's where the logging comes in handy). </p><pre><code>PHP$unit-&gt;attackDamage *= $terrain[$unit-&gt;currentTerrain]-&gt;tighnessBonus($unit-&gt;currentTerrain)</code></pre><p>The unit class contains the index (probably a string) of the relevant terrain it's on and the formation it's in.</p><p>Maybe this will show some massive flaw in my understanding of Python (6 months vs the 3 years of PHP).</p>"
